<h1 id="general-notes">General Notes</h1>
<p>The standard Serre fibration: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega X \into PX \mapsvia{f} X\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Omega X\)</span> is the loop space, <span class="math inline">\(PX\)</span> is the path space, and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the &#x201C;evaluation at the endpoint&#x201D; map. Note that <span class="math inline">\(PX\)</span> is contractible!</p>
<p>Consider a SES <span class="math inline">\(0 \into A \into B \into C \into C\)</span>, then look at it as a 2-step filtration of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(F^0B = B, F^1B = A, F^2B = 0\)</span>. The graded pieces are <span class="math inline">\(G_0 = C, G_1 = A\)</span>. Can use this to obtain LES from SS.</p>
<p>Homology in the ring-theoretic setting: If <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a Noetherian ring and <span class="math inline">\(I \subseteq R\)</span>, then if <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> can be generated by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements then <span class="math inline">\(H_I^i(M) = 0\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-module <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i &gt; n\)</span>. Thus to prove <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> can <em>not</em> be generated by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements, it suffices to find a module <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(H_I^{n+1} \neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="griffiths-and-morgan">Griffiths and Morgan</h1>
<p>Overall purpose: want to relate <span class="math inline">\(C^\infty\)</span> forms on a manifold to AT invariants. One significant result: given a manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, the singular cohomology <span class="math inline">\(H^*(M, \RR)\)</span> is isomorphic to the cohomology of the differential graded algebra of <span class="math inline">\(C^\infty\)</span> forms, <span class="math inline">\(H^*_{DR}(M)\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the de Rham cohomology..?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This DGA of smooth forms is actually enough to calculate all of the AT invariants, and can be used to build the Postnikov tower of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\tensor \RR\)</span>)</p>
<p>One construction is the localization of a CW complex at <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span>, this removes torsion and divisibility phenomena. The effect on the Postnikov tower is just then tensoring with <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span>.</p>
<p>Things that are homotopy equivalent to CW complexes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manifolds</li>
<li>Varieties</li>
<li>Loop spaces of CW complexes</li>
<li>Eilenberg-MacLane spaces? <span class="math inline">\(K(\pi, n)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Whitehead theorem holds for these: <span class="math inline">\(X \mapsvia{f} Y\)</span> is an homotopy equivalence iff <span class="math inline">\(\pi_*(X) \mapsvia{f_*} \pi_*(Y)\)</span> is an isomorphism.</p>
<p>Recall the weak topology for infinite CW complex: <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is open in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(U \cap X^n\)</span> is open for every <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Theorem: Given any <span class="math inline">\(X \mapsvia{f} Y\)</span>, we can transform this into an inclusion up to homotopy equivalence. (Just replace <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> my the mapping cylinder of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(M_f \homotopic Y\)</span>).</p>
<p>A fibration is anything that satisfies the homotopy lifting property. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locally trivial fiber bundles</li>
<li>Vector bundles</li>
<li>Covering spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Path spaces are fibrations, loop spaces are contractible.</p>
<p>Homology can be defined with coefficients in any abelian group by tensoring the singular chain groups with <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. That is, if we <span class="math inline">\(H_*(X)\)</span> obtained from</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mapsvia{\del_{n+1}} C_n(X) \mapsvia{\del_n} C_{n-1}(X) \mapsvia{\del_{n-1}} C_{n-2}(X) \cdots \mapsvia{\del_1} C_0(X)\)</span></p>
<p>then we can define <span class="math inline">\(H_*(X; G)\)</span> via</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mapsvia{\del_{n+1}\otimes 1} C_n(X)\otimes G \mapsvia{\del_n\otimes 1} C_{n-1}(X) \otimes G \cdots \mapsvia{\del_1\otimes 1} C_0(X) \otimes G\)</span></p>
<p>Note that homology has the structure of a graded group, while cohomology has the structure of a graded commutative ring.</p>
<p>Axioms of homology:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X \mapsvia{f} Y\)</span> always induces a map on homology <span class="math inline">\(H_*(X) \mapsvia{f_*}H_*(Y)\)</span></li>
<li>An orientation on <span class="math inline">\(S^n\)</span> induces an isomorphism <span class="math inline">\(H_n(S^n) \cong \ZZ\)</span>; reversing orientation induces the map <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ \mapsvia{\phi}\ZZ: \phi(1) = -1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y\subseteq X\)</span> yields the definition of relative homology <span class="math inline">\(H_*(X, Y)\)</span>, and Mayer Vietoris holds; i.e.&#xA0;there is a long exact sequence <span class="math inline">\(\cdots H_n(Y) \into H_n(X) \into H_n(X, Y) \into H_{n-1}(Y) \cdots\)</span></li>
<li>Excision: <span class="math inline">\(U \subset Y \subset X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar U \subset Y^\circ\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(H_*(X-U, Y-U) \cong H_*(X,Y)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any homology theory satisfying these properties is equivalent to singular homology.</p>
<p>Use notation <span class="math inline">\([X, Y]\)</span> for homotopy classes of maps <span class="math inline">\(X\into Y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(X) = [S^1, X]\)</span> and we can define <span class="math inline">\(\pi_n(X) = [S^n, X]\)</span>. Homotopy groups fail excision.</p>
<p>Whitehead theorem: for CW complexes, if <span class="math inline">\(X \mapsvia{f} Y\)</span> induces <span class="math inline">\(\pi_n(X) \mapsvia{f_*} \pi_n(Y)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_*\)</span> is an isomorphism (and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is connected), then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a homotopy equivalence. For spaces that aren&#x2019;t CW complexes, this may fail, and we say <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a <em>weak homotopy equivalence</em> instead.</p>
<p>Hurewicz theorem: the bottom homology and homotopy groups are isomorphic, and homology below the bottom homology is zero.</p>
<p>General note: there are equivalent &#x201C;relative versions&#x201D; of most of these theorems.</p>
<p><strong>Spectral Sequence:</strong> Page 45.</p>
<p>For any fibration <span class="math inline">\(F \mapsvia{} E \mapsvia{\pi} B\)</span>, we get a LES in homotopy <span class="math inline">\(\pi_n(F) \into \pi_n(E) \into \pi_n(B) \mapsvia{\del} \pi_{n-1}(F)\)</span></p>
<p>Basic question: How are the cohomologies of <span class="math inline">\(F,E,B\)</span> related? An easy case is when <span class="math inline">\(E=F\cross B\)</span>, but even then <span class="math inline">\(\pi_n(F\cross B) \neq \pi_n(F) \oplus \pi_n(B)\)</span>. Need the Kunneth theorem, formula is more complicated.</p>
<p>For CW complexes and a fibration, the relationship is nice - look at the total space of the fibration. It is filtered by increasing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-skeleta, and we use the LES. More general filtrations need a spectral sequence.</p>
<p><em>Note: use LES as trivial example of spectral sequence! Write out the pages, differentials, etc</em></p>
<p>The spectral sequence relates the cohomology of <em>successive pairs</em> in the filtration to the cohomology of the total space.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: If <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is path-connected and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(B, b_0)\)</span> acts trivially on <span class="math inline">\(H^*(F)\)</span>, then there are isomorphisms <span class="math display">\[
H^n(E^p, E^{p-1}) \cong \prod_{\text{$p$-cells in $B$}} H^n(\pi^{-1}e^p, \pi^{-1}\del e^p) \\ \cong C^p(B; H^{n-p}(F))
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, for any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, we can think of <span class="math inline">\(H^*(E^p, E^{p-k})\)</span> as a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th approximation to <span class="math inline">\(H^*(E^p)\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Should probably review results about polynomial and exterior algebras. And what does it mean for <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1\)</span> to act trivially on a fiber?)</p>

<h2 id="postnikov-towers">Postnikov Towers</h2>
<p>A decomposition dual to cell decomposition, the atoms of the space are Eilenberg-Maclane spaces <span class="math inline">\(K(\pi, n)\)</span>. (Note the spheres are atomic in homology, while the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> are atomic in homotopy.)</p>
<p>Gives a way of going back and forth between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_*(X)\)</span>: defined as a tower of spaces <span class="math inline">\(X_0 \leftarrow X_1 \leftarrow \cdots\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X_{i-1} \leftarrow X_i\)</span> is a fibration</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\pi_k(X_n) = \mathbb{1}[k \leq n]\cdot\pi_k(X) + \mathbb{1}[k &gt; n]\cdot 0\)</span>
<ul>
<li>So all lower homotopy groups agree at the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th spot</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Probably) <span class="math inline">\(X_i \injects X\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Unique up to homotopy, <span class="math inline">\(X = \lim_n X_n\)</span> (an inverse limit). Essentially constructs <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(K(\pi_n(X), n)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Note: revisit and draw diagrams for Postnikov Towers</em></p>
<p>Homotopy and homology commute with direct limits.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((\cdot \tensor \QQ)\)</span> is a right-exact functor, most results in this section are about how terms in exact sequences all become <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span>-vector spaces. In particular, <span class="math inline">\(H^*(X; \QQ), H_*(X;\QQ)\)</span> are.</p>
<p>Homotopy theory over <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span> is much easier than over <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>. Samples results: <span class="math display">\[
\pi_i(S^{2n-1}) \otimes \QQ = \begin{cases}
\QQ &amp; i=2n-1 \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>Then using the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_i(S^{2n-1})\)</span> is always finitely generated, we can conclude <span class="math display">\[
\pi_i(S^{2n-1}) = \begin{cases}
\ZZ &amp; i=2n-1 \\
\text{a finite group}  ~G &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]</span> This yields for even <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\pi_i(S^{n})  = \begin{cases}
\ZZ &amp; i=n \\
\ZZ \oplus G &amp; i=2n-1 \\
H &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]</span> for some finite groups <span class="math inline">\(G,H\)</span>!</p>
<p>Can also obtain Bott Periodicity this way.</p>
<h2 id="other-reading">Other Reading</h2>
<p>Lots of good examples of computations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serre_spectral_sequence">here</a></p>
<p>Some fibrations</p>
<ul>
<li>Hopf: <span class="math inline">\(S^1 \into S^3 \into S^2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(S^1 \into S^{2n+1} \into \CP^n\)</span></li>
<li>Path space: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega S^n \into PS^n \into S^n\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Serre Spectral Sequence Example: For the fibration <span class="math inline">\(S^1 \into S^3 \into S^2\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> page: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
1 &amp;&amp; H^0(S^2, \ZZ) &amp;&amp; H^1(S^2, \ZZ) &amp;&amp; H^2(S^2, \ZZ) \\
0  &amp;&amp; H^0(S^2, \ZZ) &amp;&amp; H^1(S^2, \ZZ) &amp;&amp; H^2(S^2, \ZZ) \\
\hline
 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 1 &amp;&amp; 2
\end{array}
\]</span> Which is equal to <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
1 &amp;&amp; H^0(S^2, \ZZ) &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; H^2(S^2, \ZZ) \\
0  &amp;&amp; H^0(S^2, \ZZ) &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; H^2(S^2, \ZZ) \\
\hline
 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 1 &amp;&amp; 2
\end{array}
\]</span> And <span class="math inline">\(E_3 = E_\infty\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(d_2^{0,1}\)</span> is an isomorphism.</p>
<p><em>Note: Probably a good starting point for basic calculations? Fill out the missing details for this table.</em></p>
<p>Challenge: Prove <span class="math inline">\(\pi_4(S^2) = \frac{\ZZ}{2\ZZ}\)</span></p>

<p>Paper on &#x201C;constructive&#x201D; algebraic topology <a href="https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Papers/Constructive-AT.pdf">J. Rubio, F. Sergeraert / Bull. Sci. math. 126 (2002) 389&#x2013;412 403</a></p>
<p>Many constructions in algebraic topology can be organized as solutions of fibration problems.</p>
<p>In particular the classifying space <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> of a topological group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the solution for a fibration <span class="math inline">\(BG \cross_\tau G\)</span> where the fiber space is the given group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, the base space is the classifying space <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> and the product <span class="math inline">\(BG \cross G\)</span> is twisted in such a way the total space <span class="math inline">\(BG \cross_\tau G\)</span> is contractible. The same idea where the base space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is given and the fibre space is unknown leads to the loop space <span class="math inline">\(\Omega X\)</span> and the contractible total space <span class="math inline">\(X \cross_\tau \Omega X\)</span>.</p>
<p>The handbooks of Algebraic Topology more or less explain the Eilenberg&#x2013;Moore spectral sequence can be used to &#x201C;compute&#x201D; the homology groups of the new objects <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(&#x2126;X\)</span> if the homology groups of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are known. In fact this spectral sequence is in general unable to give you the new homology groups, unless you are in a very special situation. The Serre spectral sequence works in the third situation, when you are looking for the homology groups of a total space <span class="math inline">\(B \cross_\tau F\)</span> if the homology groups of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are known; but in general you meet the same difficulties with the higher differentials and the extension problems at abutment.</p>
<hr>
<p>if one understood even the stable homotopy groups of spheres very well, one would therefore have a near complete understanding of the group (I assume that <span class="math inline">\(n\neq 4\)</span>) of differentiable structures on the n-sphere: see e.g.</p>
<p>The homotopy group <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;_{n+k}(S^k)\)</span> is a finite group except</p>

<p>The rough idea of obstruction theory is simple. Suppose we want to construct some kind of function on a CW complex <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. We do this by induction: if the function is defined on the k-skeleton <span class="math inline">\(X_k\)</span>, we try to extend it over the <span class="math inline">\((k + 1)\dash\)</span>skeleton <span class="math inline">\(X^{k+1}\)</span>. The obstruction to extending over a <span class="math inline">\((k + 1)\dash\)</span>cell is an element of <span class="math inline">\(\pi_k\)</span> of something. These obstructions fit together to give a cellular cochain on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with coefficients in this <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;_k\)</span>. In fact this cochain is a cocycle, so it defines an &#x201C;obstruction class&#x201D; in <span class="math inline">\(H_{k+1}(X; &#x3C0;_k(something))\)</span>. If this cohomology class is zero, i.e.&#xA0;if there is a cellular <span class="math inline">\(k\dash\)</span>cochain <span class="math inline">\(&#x3B7;\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(0 = &#x3B4;&#x3B7;\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(&#x3B7;\)</span> prescribes a way to modify our map over the <span class="math inline">\(k\dash\)</span>skeleton so that it can be extended over the <span class="math inline">\((k + 1)\dash\)</span>skeleton</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> homomorphism seems to link the framed bordism classes of manifolds to homotopy groups of spheres - for example <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> takes <span class="math inline">\(\pi_k(SL^n(R))\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{n}^k S^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>What is the <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> homomorphism? Look at the map <span class="math display">\[
SO(n) \to \Omega^n S^n\\
A: (\RR^n \to \RR^n) \mapsto A^+
\]</span></p>
<p>Where we view a matrix as a linear function on <span class="math inline">\(\RR^n\)</span>, and take it to its compactification which is a map <span class="math inline">\(S^n\to S^n\)</span>. Taking the limit yields a map from <span class="math inline">\(SO^\infty \to QS^0 = \ \Omega^\infty \Sigma^\infty S^0\)</span>, and taking <span class="math inline">\(\pi_0\)</span> of both sides induces the <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> homomorphism. The RHS is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\pi_*^s\)</span>, the stable homotopy groups of spheres. But the homotopy groups of <span class="math inline">\(SO\)</span> were computed by Bott, and have some 8-fold periodicity.</p>
<p>The image of <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> was found by Adams in &#x2019;66 or so, it is a finite group with order the denominator of some function involving Bernoulli numbers. However, the pattern is more apparent by looking at the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-stems, then the number of connected dots really just depends on the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic divisibilty of the horizontal number plus 1. The image of <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is just the bottom row in these stem diagrams.</p>
<p>How to read the stem diagrams? Each one is for a fixed <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, for example at <span class="math inline">\(p=2\)</span> each dot depicts a factor of 2 and vertical lines denote additive extensions. For example, <span class="math inline">\(\cdot \to \cdot \to \cdot\)</span> vertically would denote <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ_{2^3} = \ZZ_2 \oplus \ZZ_2 \oplus \ZZ_2\)</span>, whereas <span class="math inline">\(\cdot \to \cdot\)</span> denotes <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ_2 \oplus \ZZ_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The EHP sequence is good for unstable stuff, not the best for stable - use the Adams spectral sequence instead.</p>
<p>The stable homotopy groups of spheres are isomorphic to the framed cobordism groups of manifolds. The Kervaire invariant has to do with which stable homotopy groups can be represented by exotic spheres. There are several open problems related to differentials and invariants the arise from this SS, e.g.&#xA0;what are the permanent cycles? The Kervaire Invariant Problem was only recently solved by Hopkins-Ravenel-Hill.</p>
<p>The Adams-Novikov SS ends up being cleaner, fewer differentials!</p>

<p>It is &#x2018;&#x2019;well-known&#x2019;&#x2019; that the third stable homotopy group of spheres is cyclic of order 24. It is also &#x201C;well-known&#x201D; that the quaternionic Hopf map <span class="math inline">\(&#x3BD;:S^7&#x2192;S^4\)</span>, an <span class="math inline">\(S^3\)</span>-bundle, suspends to a generator of <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;_8(S^5)=&#x3C0;^{st}_3\)</span>. It is even better known that the complex Hopf map <span class="math inline">\(&#x3B7;:S^3 \to S^2\)</span> suspends to a generator of <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;_4(S^3)=&#x3C0;^{st}_1=\ZZ_2\)</span>. For this, there is a reasonably elementary argument, see e.g.&#xA0;Bredon, Topology and Geometry, page 465.</p>
<p>As we have seen in this MO question, and also this one, the K3 surface plays an important role in the third stable homotopy group of spheres. It can be viewed as the source of the 24 in this group <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;^{st}_3=\ZZ_{24}\)</span>. Here is a brief review of how that goes: the stable homotopy groups (in degree <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) of spheres are the same as cobordism classes of stably framed manifolds (of dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>). In dimension 3 the generator is given by <span class="math inline">\(&#x3BD;=(S^3,Lie)\)</span>, the 3-sphere with its Lie group framing (where we think of <span class="math inline">\(S^3&#x2286;H\)</span> as the group of unit quaternions).</p>
<p>The homotopy groups <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;_i(S^3)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i\leq 64\)</span> are apparently computed in:</p>
<p>Curtis, Edward B.,Mahowald, Mark, The unstable Adams spectral sequence for <span class="math inline">\(S^3\)</span>, Algebraic topology (Evanston, IL, 1988), 125&#x2013;162, Contemp. Math., 96, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 1989.</p>
<p>The Pontryagin-Thom construction shows that the stable homotopy groups of spheres are the same as the groups of stably framed manifolds up to cobordism.</p>
<p>The best overall summary of results would be Doug Ravenel&#x2019;s book on the homotopy groups of spheres, and I would also recommend Kochman&#x2019;s book. Read works of Mark Mahowald for results using the Adams spectral sequence, and Doug Ravenel for the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. Complete or nearly complete calculations for the homotopy groups of spheres that have been localized at a particular Morava K-theory have been made by Toda, Goerss-Henn-Mahowald-Rezk, and Mark Behrens. If you&#x2019;re interested in computer calculations of Ext, you should contact Robert Bruner or Christian Nassau. Many others have contributed to the calculation of homotopy groups of spheres and probably deserve to be mentioned (if I omitted someone, it was unintentional).</p>
<p><em>One of the most recent spectacular advances in algebraic topology was the solution of (most of) the Kervaire invariant 1 problem by Hill, Hopkins and Ravenel about framed manifolds/stable homotopy groups of spheres.</em> They used a tremendous amount of stuff to solve this classical problem: equivariant topology, chromatic homotopy theory, spectral sequences, orthogonal spectra, abstract homotopy theory, &#x2026;</p>

Is <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> diffeomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(S^n\)</span>? For <span class="math inline">\(n= 3\)</span>, the answer is yes. It is due to Moise [37] that every closed 3-manifold has a unique smooth structure. In particular, the 3-sphere has a unique smooth structure. <strong>For n= 4, this question is wildly open.</strong> For higher dimensions, Milnor [35] constructed an exotic smooth structure on <span class="math inline">\(S^7\)</span>.

In fact, Kervaire and Milnor constructed a group <span class="math inline">\(&#x398;_n\)</span>, which is the group of h-cobordism classes of homotopy <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-spheres.

<p>Stacks and orbifolds are concepts from algebraic geometry (respectively geometric topology) that allow us to talk about objects that locally look like the quotient of a smooth object by a group action, in a way that remembers information about the isotropy groups of the action. Such &#x2018;stacky&#x2019; objects can behave like smooth objects even if the underlying spaces have singularities. As for spaces, manifolds,and schemes, cohomology theories are important invariants also for stacks and orbifolds, and examples such as ordinary cohomology or K-theory lend themselves to generalization. Special cases of orbifolds are &#x2018;global quotients&#x2019;, often denoted M/G, for example for a smooth action of a compact Lie group G on a smooth manifold M. In such examples, the orbifold cohomology of M/G is supposed to be the G-equivariant cohomology of M. This suggests away to do orbifold cohomology theories by means of equivariant stable homotopy theory,via suitable G-spectra. However, since the group G is not intrinsic and can vary, one needs equivariant cohomology theories for all groups G, with some compatibility. Global homotopy theory makes this idea precise.</p>

<p>From Hatcher:</p>
<p>While my Algebraic Topology book and my unfinished book on spectral sequences (referred to in other answers to this question) contain some information about homotopy groups of spheres, they don&#x2019;t really qualify as a general survey or introduction. One source that fits this bill more closely is Chapter 1 of Doug Ravenel&#x2019;s &#x201C;green book&#x201D; Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres, from 1986. This introductory chapter starts at a reasonably accessible level, with increasing prerequisites in the later sections of the chapter. More recent surveys ought to exist, although at the moment I can&#x2019;t recall any. With the recent solution of the Kervaire invariant problem by Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, this would be a good time for an updated survey.</p>
<p>Connections between homotopy groups of spheres and low-dimensional geometry and topology have traditionally been somewhat limited, with the Hopf bundle being the thing that comes most immediately to mind. A fairly recent connection is Soren Galatius&#x2019; theorem that the homology groups of <span class="math inline">\(Aut(F_n)\)</span>, the automorphism group of a free group, are isomorphic in a stable range of dimensions to the homology groups of &#x201C;loop-infinity S-infinity&#x201D;, the space whose homotopy groups are the stable homotopy groups of spheres.</p>
<p>Other posters have alluded to the Kervaire-Milnor theory (from &#x201C;Groups of homotopy spheres. I&#x201D;) which shows how, via Pontryagin-Thom, our knowledge and ignorance about the stable homotopy groups of spheres is reflected in knowledge and ignorance about classification of manifolds. Maybe it&#x2019;s worth telling this (really beautiful!) story.</p>
<p>In each dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, one has a group <span class="math inline">\(&#x398;_n\)</span> of smooth <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-manifolds that are homotopy <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-spheres, up to h-cobordism, under connected sum. This has a subgroup <span class="math inline">\(bP_{n+1}\)</span> of boundaries of parallelizable <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>-manifolds. Assume n&gt;4, so h-cobordism classes are diffeomorphism classes.</p>
<p>Every homotopy <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-sphere <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> can be shown to have a stable framing. Hence (by P-T) <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a regular fibre of a map <span class="math inline">\(S_{n+k}\to S_k\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(k&#x226B;0\)</span> whose class in <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;_{n+k}(S_k)\)</span> is the obstruction to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (with chosen stable framing) being a framed boundary. Changing the stable framing amounts to adding something in the image of the <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>-homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(J: &#x3C0;_n(SO(k)) \to &#x3C0;_{n+k}(S_k)\)</span>. So we get an injective homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(&#x398;_n/bP_{n+1}&#x2192;\coker(J)\)</span> (which is onto e.g.&#xA0;for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> odd).</p>
<p>We don&#x2019;t know <span class="math inline">\(\coker(J)\)</span> in high dimensions, so we don&#x2019;t know the order of <span class="math inline">\(&#x398;_n/bP_{n+1}\)</span>. But Serre&#x2019;s finiteness theorem for the stable stems tells us that <span class="math inline">\(&#x398;_n/bP_{n+1}\)</span> is finite!</p>
<p>The subgroup <span class="math inline">\(bP_{n+1}\)</span> is analyzed via surgery theory and the h-cobordism theorem. There&#x2019;s a nice summary in L&#xFC;ck&#x2019;s Basic introduction to surgery theory.</p>
<p>We have <span class="math inline">\(bP_{odd}=0\)</span>. There&#x2019;s a formula for <span class="math inline">\(bP_{4p}\)</span> involving Bernoulli numerators; this comes from a known (thanks to Adams) part of the stable stems, namely, <span class="math inline">\(\im(J)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="math inline">\(bP_{4p+2}\)</span> is at most <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span>. Here <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> bounds a parallelizable manifold <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. We&#x2019;d like to make this contractible. By framed surgery, we can kill the homotopy groups of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> below the middle dimension but the Arf invariant of the pairing on middle-dimensional homology obstructs the final step, that of killing <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;_{p+1}\)</span>. Say this is non-zero. Can we do better by starting with a different <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>? Yes, if and only if there&#x2019;s a closed, framed <span class="math inline">\(2_{p+2}\)</span>-manifold of Kervaire invariant one.</p>
<p>Browder showed that the Kervaire invariant can be one only when <span class="math inline">\(4p+2=2l&#x2212;2\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, and Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel have shown that <span class="math inline">\(l&#x2264;7\)</span>. Conclusion: <span class="math inline">\(bP_{4p+2}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> except in dimensions 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126, where it&#x2019;s zero.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group#Lie_groups">Justification for Lie Group Computations</a> Here is a very fundamental way to create interesting Riemannian manifolds: Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a semi-simple Lie group, let <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> be its maximal compact subgroup, let <span class="math inline">\(&#x393;\)</span> be a discrete subgroup of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and form <span class="math inline">\(G/K\)</span>. This quotient is called the symmetric space attached to <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Riemannian structure comes from an invariant metric on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and so <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> acts as isometries on <span class="math inline">\(G/K\)</span> by left translation.</p>
<p>If you now take a discrete subgroup <span class="math inline">\(&#x393;\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, you can form the double quotient <span class="math inline">\(&#x393;&#x2216;G/K\)</span>. These are some of the most celebrated Riemannian manifolds in mathematics. In the case of <span class="math inline">\(SL_2(\RR)\)</span>, we know via uniformization that all genus <span class="math inline">\(g&#x2265;2\)</span> Riemann surfaces can be described in this way. In the case of <span class="math inline">\(SL_2(\CC)\)</span> we get hyperbolic 3-manifolds, from symplectic groups we get moduli spaces of abelian varieties, &#x2026; .</p>
<p>P.S. I should also note that the study of spaces <span class="math inline">\(&#x393;&#x2216;G/K\)</span> for certain <span class="math inline">\(&#x393;\)</span> (so-called congruence subgroups) is one of the basic topics of the Langlands program, and the function theory and cohomology of these spaces (especially their representation-theoretic structure) is conjectured to govern a vast amount of number theory. Trying to understand and work on these conjectures was my own motivation for learning Lie theory.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan_connection">More info</a></p>
<p>A Klein geometry consists of a Lie group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> together with a Lie subgroup <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Together <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> determine a homogeneous space <span class="math inline">\(G/H\)</span>, on which the group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> acts by left-translation. Klein&#x2019;s aim was then to study objects living on the homogeneous space which were congruent by the action of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. A Cartan geometry extends the notion of a Klein geometry by attaching to each point of a manifold a copy of a Klein geometry, and to regard this copy as tangent to the manifold. Thus the geometry of the manifold is infinitesimally identical to that of the Klein geometry, but globally can be quite different. In particular, Cartan geometries no longer have a well-defined action of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> on them. However, a Cartan connection supplies a way of connecting the infinitesimal model spaces within the manifold by means of parallel transport.</p>

<p>A principal <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> bundle is a locally trivial free <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-space with orbit space <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is discrete, then a principal <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-bundle over <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with total space <span class="math inline">\(\tilde X\)</span> is equivalent to a regular covering map with <span class="math inline">\(Aut(\tilde X) = G\)</span>.

<p>It is useful to think of <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> as a space whose points are copies of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, so the classifying map <span class="math inline">\(X \mapsvia{f} BG\)</span> assigns each <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> to the fiber above <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, which is a <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>

<p>Connected covers can kill higher homotopy?</p>
<p>You can realize any Eilenberg-MacLane space as a classifying space.</p>
<p>Claim: <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{i+k}B^kG = \pi_i G\)</span>.</p>
<p>Proof: If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a topological group, there is a universal principal <span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span>bundle <span class="math inline">\(EG \to BG\)</span> which induces a LES in homotopy.

When <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> space, <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> is a topological group, and so <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{i+2}(B^2G) = \pi_{i+2}(B(BG)) = \pi_{i+1}(BG) = \pi_i(G)\)</span> and we conclude the result.</p>
<p>Corollary: If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a discrete group, <span class="math inline">\(B^kG = K(G, n)\)</span>. Proof: Then <span class="math inline">\(\pi_0 G = G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_i G = 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i &gt; 0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\pi_k B^k G = G\)</span>.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s possible to take classifying spaces of stacks. E.g. there is a stack that classifies principal bundles <em>with connections</em>, but it has issues: it is not a presentable stack, i.e.&#xA0;not covered by a manifold, so an associated sheaf is not representable.</p>

<h1 id="difference-between-low-and-high-dimensional-topology">Difference between low and high dimensional topology</h1>
<p>High-dimensional topology refers to manifolds of dimension 5 and above, or in relative terms, embeddings in codimension 3 and above. Low-dimensional topology is concerned with questions in dimensions up to 4, or embeddings in codimension up to 2.</p>
<p>The distinction is because surgery theory works in dimension 5 and above (in fact, it works topologically in dimension 4, though this is very involved to prove), and thus the behavior of manifolds in dimension 5 and above is controlled algebraically by surgery theory. In dimension 4 and below (topologically, in dimension 3 and below), surgery theory does not work, and other phenomena occur.</p>
<p>The precise reason for the difference at dimension 5 is because the Whitney embedding theorem, the key technical trick which underlies surgery theory, requires 2+1 dimensions.</p>
<p>Low-dimensional topology is strongly geometric, as reflected in the uniformization theorem in 2 dimensions &#x2013; every surface admits a constant curvature metric; geometrically, it has one of 3 possible geometries: positive curvature/spherical, zero curvature/flat, negative curvature/hyperbolic &#x2013; and the geometrization theorem in 3 dimensions &#x2013; every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of 8 possible geometries.</p>
<h1 id="characteristic-classes">Characteristic Classes</h1>
<p>A characteristic class is a way of associating to each principal bundle on a topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> a cohomology class of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. The cohomology class measures the extent to which the bundle is &#x201C;twisted&#x201D; &#x2014; particularly, whether it possesses sections or not. In other words, characteristic classes are global invariants which measure the deviation of a local product structure from a global product structure. They are one of the unifying geometric concepts in algebraic topology, differential geometry and algebraic geometry.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a topological group, and for a topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, write <span class="math inline">\(bG(X)\)</span> for the set of isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles. This <span class="math inline">\(bG\)</span> is a contravariant functor from Top (the category of topological spaces and continuous functions) to Set (the category of sets and functions), sending a map <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to the pullback operation <span class="math inline">\(f*\)</span>.</p>
<p>A characteristic class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> of principal <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-bundles is then a natural transformation from <span class="math inline">\(bG\)</span> to a cohomology functor <span class="math inline">\(H*\)</span>, regarded also as a functor to Set.</p>
<p>In other words, a characteristic class associates to any principal <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-bundle <span class="math inline">\(P &#x2192; X\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(bG(X)\)</span> an element <span class="math inline">\(c(P)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(H^* (X)\)</span> such that, if <span class="math inline">\(f : Y &#x2192; X\)</span> is a continuous map, then <span class="math inline">\(c(f^* P) = f^* c(P)\)</span>. On the left is the class of the pullback of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>; on the right is the image of the class of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> under the induced map in cohomology.</p>
<p>When the theory was put on an organized basis around 1950 (with the definitions reduced to homotopy theory) it became clear that the most fundamental characteristic classes known at that time (the Stiefel&#x2013;Whitney class, the Chern class, and the Pontryagin classes) were reflections of the classical linear groups and their maximal torus structure.</p>
<p>The prime mechanism then appeared to be this: Given a space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> carrying a vector bundle, that implied in the homotopy category a mapping from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to a classifying space <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>, for the relevant linear group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. For the homotopy theory the relevant information is carried by compact subgroups such as the orthogonal groups and unitary groups of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Once the cohomology <span class="math inline">\({\displaystyle H^* (BG)}\)</span> was calculated, once and for all, the contravariance property of cohomology meant that characteristic classes for the bundle would be defined in <span class="math inline">\({\displaystyle H^* (X)}\)</span> in the same dimensions.</p>
<p>Characteristic numbers solve the oriented and unoriented bordism questions: two manifolds are (respectively oriented or unoriented) cobordant if and only if their characteristic numbers are equal.</p>
<h1 id="schoenflies-problem">Schoenflies Problem</h1>
<p>A sharpening of Jordan curve theorem. It states that not only does every simple closed curve in the plane separate the plane into two regions, one (the &#x201C;inside&#x201D;) bounded and the other (the &#x201C;outside&#x201D;) unbounded; but also that these two regions are homeomorphic to the inside and outside of a standard circle in the plane.</p>
<h1 id="uniformization-theorem">Uniformization Theorem</h1>
<p>The uniformization theorem says that every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of the three Riemann surfaces: the open unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere. In particular it implies that every Riemann surface admits a Riemannian metric of constant curvature.</p>
<p>For compact Riemann surfaces, those with universal cover the unit disk are precisely the hyperbolic surfaces of genus greater than 1, all with non-abelian fundamental group; those with universal cover the complex plane are the Riemann surfaces of genus 1, namely the complex tori or elliptic curves with fundamental group <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span>; and those with universal cover the Riemann sphere are those of genus zero, namely the Riemann sphere itself, with trivial fundamental group.</p>
<p>The uniformization theorem is a generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem from proper simply connected open subsets of the plane to arbitrary simply connected Riemann surfaces.</p>
<p>Every Riemann surface is the quotient of a free, proper and holomorphic action of a discrete group on its universal covering and this universal covering is holomorphically isomorphic (one also says: &#x201C;conformally equivalent&#x201D; or &#x201C;biholomorphic&#x201D;) to one of the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the Riemann sphere</li>
<li>the complex plane</li>
<li>the unit disk in the complex plane.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 3 dimensions, there are 8 geometries, called the eight Thurston geometries. Not every 3-manifold admits a geometry, but Thurston&#x2019;s geometrization conjecture proved by Grigori Perelman states that every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces that are geometrizable.</p>

<p>An action of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, analogous to <span class="math inline">\((x, g)h = (x, gh)\)</span> for a product space. A projection onto <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For a product space, this is just the projection onto the first factor, <span class="math inline">\((x,g) &#x21A6; x\)</span>.</p>
<p>A principal <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-bundle, where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> denotes any topological group, is a fiber bundle <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;:P &#x2192; X\)</span> together with a continuous right action <span class="math inline">\(P &#xD7; G &#x2192; P\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> preserves the fibers of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (i.e.&#xA0;if <span class="math inline">\(y &#x2208; P_x\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(yg &#x2208; P_x\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(g &#x2208; G\)</span>) and acts freely and transitively on them. This implies that each fiber of the bundle is homeomorphic to the group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> itself.</p>
<p>Since the group action preserves the fibers of <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;:P &#x2192; X\)</span> and acts transitively, it follows that the orbits of the <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-action are precisely these fibers and the orbit space <span class="math inline">\(P/G\)</span> is homeomorphic to the base space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Because the action is free, the fibers have the structure of <span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span>torsors. A <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-torsor is a space which is homeomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> but lacks a group structure since there is no preferred choice of an identity element.</p>
<p><strong>One of the most important questions regarding any fiber bundle is whether or not it is trivial, i.e.&#xA0;isomorphic to a product bundle.</strong> A principal bundle is trivial if and only if it admits a global cross section.</p>
<h2 id="examples-1">Examples</h2>
<p>The prototypical example of a smooth principal bundle is the frame bundle of a smooth manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, often denoted <span class="math inline">\(FM\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(GL(M)\)</span>. Here the fiber over a point <span class="math inline">\(x &#x2208; M\)</span> is the set of all frames (i.e.&#xA0;ordered bases) for the tangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_xM\)</span>. The general linear group <span class="math inline">\(GL(n,\RR)\)</span> acts freely and transitively on these frames. These fibers can be glued together in a natural way so as to obtain a principal <span class="math inline">\(GL(n,\RR)\)</span>-bundle over <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>A normal (regular) covering space <span class="math inline">\(p:C &#x2192; X\)</span> is a principal bundle where the structure group</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G=\pi _{1}(X)/p_* (\pi_{1}(C))\]</span></p>
<p>acts on the fibers of p via the monodromy action. In particular, the universal cover of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a principal bundle over <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with structure group <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;_1(X)\)</span> (since the universal cover is simply connected and thus <span class="math inline">\(&#x3C0;_1(C)\)</span> is trivial).</p>
<h2 id="classification">Classification</h2>
<p>Any topological group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> admits a classifying space <span class="math inline">\(BG:\)</span> the quotient by the action of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> of some weakly contractible space <span class="math inline">\(EG\)</span>, i.e.&#xA0;a topological space with vanishing homotopy groups. The classifying space has the property that any <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> principal bundle over a paracompact manifold <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is isomorphic to a pullback of the principal bundle <span class="math inline">\(EG &#x2192; BG\)</span>.</p>
<p>In fact, more is true, as the set of isomorphism classes of principal <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> bundles over the base <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> identifies with the set of homotopy classes of maps <span class="math inline">\(B &#x2192; BG\)</span>.</p>

<h1 id="fiber-bundles">Fiber Bundles</h1>
<p>What is a fiber bundle? Generally speaking, it is similar to a fibration - we require the homotopy lifting property to hold, although it is not necessary that path lifting is unique. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Homotopy_lifting_property.png" alt="lifting - todo tikz"></p>
<p>However, it also satisfies more conditions - in particular, the condition of <em>local triviality</em>. This requires that the total space looks like a product locally, although there may some type of global monodromy. Thus with some mild conditions<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, fiber bundles will be instances of fibrations (or alternatively, fibrations are a generalization of fiber bundles, whichever you prefer!)</p>
<p>As with fibrations, we can interpret a fiber bundle as &#x201C;a family of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>s indexed/parameterized by <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>s&#x201D;, and the general shape data of a fiber bundle is similarly given by</p>
<div class="code-chunk" data-id="code-chunk-id-0" data-cmd="latex"><div class="input-div"><div class="btn-group"><div class="run-btn btn"><span>&#x25B6;&#xFE0E;</span></div><div class="run-all-btn btn">all</div></div><div class="status">running...</div></div><div class="output-div"></div></div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the base space, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the total space, <span class="math inline">\(\pi: E \to B\)</span> is the projection map, and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is &#x201C;the&#x201D; fiber (in this case, unique up to homeomorphism). Fiber bundles are often described in shorthand by the data <span class="math inline">\(E \mapsvia{\pi}B\)</span>, or occasionally by tuples such as <span class="math inline">\((E, \pi, B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The local triviality condition is a requirement that the projection <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> locally factors through the product; that is, for each open set <span class="math inline">\(U\in B\)</span>, there is a homeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> making this diagram commute:</p>
<div class="code-chunk" data-id="code-chunk-id-1" data-cmd="latex"><div class="input-div"><div class="btn-group"><div class="run-btn btn"><span>&#x25B6;&#xFE0E;</span></div><div class="run-all-btn btn">all</div></div><div class="status">running...</div></div><div class="output-div"></div></div>
<p>Fiber bundles may admit right-inverses to the projection map <span class="math inline">\(s: B\to E\)</span> satisfying <span class="math inline">\(\pi \circ s = \id_B\)</span>, denoted <em>sections</em>. Equivalently, for each <span class="math inline">\(b\in B\)</span>, a section is a choice of an element <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> in the preimage <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}(b) \homotopic F\)</span> (i.e.&#xA0;the fiber over <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>). Sections are sometimes referred to as <em>cross-sections</em> in older literature, due to the fact that a choice of section yields might be schematically represented as such:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../home/zack/notes/images/2018/05/foliation-diagram.png" alt><figcaption>foliation diagram</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here, we imagine each fiber as a cross-section or &#x201C;level set&#x201D; of the total space, giving rise to a &#x201C;foliation&#x201D; of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> by the fibers.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>For a given bundle, it is generally possible to choose sections locally, but there may or may not exist globally defined sections. Thus one key question is <strong>when does a fiber bundle admit a global section?</strong></p>
<p>A bundle is said to be <em>trivial</em> if <span class="math inline">\(E = F \cross B\)</span>, and so another important question is <strong>when is a fiber bundle trivial?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A fiber bundle in which <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(k\dash\)</span>vector space for some field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is referred to as a <em>rank <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vector bundle.</em> When <span class="math inline">\(k=\RR, \CC\)</span>, they are denoted real/complex vector bundles respectively. A vector bundle of rank <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is often referred to as a <em>line bundle</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: There are in fact non-trivial fiber bundles. Consider the space <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> that can appear as the total space in a line bundle over the circle</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \RR^1 \to E \to S^1\]</span></p>
<p>That is, the total spaces that occur when a one-dimensional real vector space (i.e.&#xA0;a real line) is chosen at each point of <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>. One possibility is the trivial bundle <span class="math inline">\(E \cong S^1 \cross \RR \cong S^1 \cross I^\circ \in \text{DiffTop}\)</span>, which is an &#x201C;open cylinder&#x201D;:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../home/zack/notes/images/2018/05/cylinder.png" alt><figcaption>cylinder</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But another possibility is <span class="math inline">\(E \cong M^\circ \in\text{DiffTop}\)</span>, an open M&#xF6;bius band:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../home/zack/notes/images/2018/05/mobius-band.png" alt><figcaption>M&#xF6;bius band</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here we can take the base space <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to be the circle through the center of the band; then every open neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> of a point <span class="math inline">\(b\in B\)</span> contains an arc of the center circle crossed with a vertical line segment that misses <span class="math inline">\(\del M\)</span>. Thus the local picture looks like <span class="math inline">\(S^1 \cross I^\circ\)</span>, while globally <span class="math inline">\(M\not\cong S^1 \cross I^\circ \in \text{Top}\)</span>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>So in terms of fiber bundles, we have the following situation <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}
&amp;\RR &amp;\to &amp;~~~M &amp;\to &amp;S^1\\
\require{HTML} \style{display: inline-block; transform: rotate(90deg)}{=} &amp;&amp;~~~\require{HTML} \style{display: inline-block; transform: rotate(90deg)}{\neq} &amp;&amp;\require{HTML} \style{display: inline-block; transform: rotate(90deg)}{=}\\
\RR &amp;\to &amp;S^1 \cross I^\circ &amp;\to &amp;S^1
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>and thus <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is associated to a nontrivial line bundle over the circle.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> In fact, these are the only two line bundles over <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>. This leads us to a natural question, similar to the group extension question: <strong>given a base <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and fiber <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, what are the isomorphism classes of fiber bundles over <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> with fiber <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>?</strong> In general, we will find that these classes manifest themselves in homology or homotopy. As an example, we have the following result:</p>
<p><strong>Notation</strong>: Let <span class="math inline">\(I(F, B)\)</span> denote isomorphism classes of fiber bundles of the form <span class="math inline">\(F \to \wait \to B\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="proposition">Proposition:</h2>
<p>The set of isomorphism classes of smooth line bundles over a space <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> satisfies the following isomorphism of abelian groups:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I(\RR^1, B) \cong H^1(B; \ZZ_2) \in \text{Ab}\]</span></p>
<p>in which the RHS is generated by the first Stiefel-Whitney class <span class="math inline">\(w_1(B)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em></p>
<p><em>Lemma:</em> The structure group of a vector bundle is a general linear group. (Or orthogonal group, by Gram-Schmidt)</p>
<p><em>Lemma:</em> The classifying space of <span class="math inline">\(\GL(n, \RR)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\Gr(n, \RR^\infty)\)</span></p>
<p><em>Lemma</em>: <span class="math inline">\(\Gr(n, \RR^\infty) = \RP^\infty \homotopic K(\ZZ_2, 1)\)</span></p>
<p><em>Lemma:</em> For <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> an abelian group and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> a CW complex, <span class="math inline">\([X, K(G, n)] \cong H^n(X; G)\)</span></p>
<p>The structure group of a vector bundle can be taken to be either the general linear group or the orthogonal group, and the classifying space of both groups are homotopy-equivalent to an infinite real Grassmanian. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
I(\RR^1, B) &amp;= [B, B(\restrictionof{\text{(Sym$~\RR$)}}{\text{Vect}})]\\
&amp;= [B, B(\GL(1, \RR))]\\
&amp;= [B, \Gr(1, \RR^\infty)] \\
&amp;= [B, \RP^\infty] \\
&amp;= [B, K(\ZZ_2, 1)] \\
&amp;= H^1(B; \ZZ_2)
\end{align}
\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\qed\)</span></p>
<p>This is the general sort of pattern we will find - isomorphism classes of bundles will be represented by homotopy classes of maps into classifying spaces, and for nice enough classifying spaces, these will represent elements in cohomology.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: There are two isomorphism classes of line bundles over <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>, generated by the M&#xF6;bius strip, since <span class="math inline">\(H^1(S^1, \ZZ_2) = \ZZ_2\)</span> (Note: this computation follows from the fact that <span class="math inline">\(H_1(S^1) = \ZZ\)</span> and an application of both universal coefficient theorems.)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Stiefel-Whitney class is only a complete invariant of <em>line</em> bundles over a space. It is generally an incomplete invariant; for higher dimensions or different types of fibers, other invariants (so-called <em>characteristic classes</em>) will be necessary.</p>
<p>Another important piece of data corresponding to a fiber bundle is the <em>structure group</em>, which is a subgroup of <span class="math inline">\(\text{Sym}(F) \in \text{Set}\)</span> and arises from imposing conditions on the structure of the transition functions between local trivial patches. A fiber bundle with structure group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is referred to as a <em><span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span>bundle</em>.</p>
<h1 id="vector-bundles">Vector Bundles</h1>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>rank <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vector bundle</em> is a fiber bundle in which the fibers <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> have the structure of a vector space <span class="math inline">\(k^n\)</span> for some field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>; the structure group of such a bundle is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(\GL(n, k)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that a vector bundle always has one global section: namely, since every fiber is a vector space, you can canonically choose the 0 element to obtain a global zero section.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition</strong>: A rank <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vector bundle is trivial iff it admits <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> linearly independent global sections.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The tangent bundle of a manifold is an <span class="math inline">\(\RR\)</span>-vector bundle. Let <span class="math inline">\(M^n\)</span> be an <span class="math inline">\(n\dash\)</span>dimensional manifold. For any point <span class="math inline">\(x\in M\)</span>, the tangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_xM\)</span> exists, and so we can define <span class="math display">\[
TM = \coprod_{x\in M} T_xM = \theset{(x, t) \mid x\in M, t \in T_xM}
\]</span></p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> is a manifold of dimension <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> and there is a corresponding fiber bundle <span class="math display">\[
\RR^n \to TM \mapsvia{\pi} M
\]</span></p>
<p>given by a natural projection <span class="math inline">\(\pi:(x, t) \mapsto x\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong> A circle bundle is a fiber bundle in which the fiber is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> as a topological group. Consider circle bundles over a circle, which are of the form <span class="math display">\[
S^1 \to E \mapsvia{\pi} S^1
\]</span></p>
<p>There is a trivial bundle, when <span class="math inline">\(E = S^1 \cross S^1 = T^2\)</span>, the torus: <img src="../home/zack/notes/images/2018/05/torus-bundle.png" alt="torus bundle"></p>
<p>There is also a nontrivial bundle, <span class="math inline">\(E = K\)</span>, the Klein bottle: <img src="../home/zack/notes/images/2018/05/klein-bottle.png" alt="Klein bottle"></p>
<p>As in the earlier example involving the M&#xF6;bius strip, since <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is nonorientable, <span class="math inline">\(T^2 \not\cong K\)</span> and there are thus at least two distinct bundles of this type.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Remark</em>: A section of the tangent bundle <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> is equivalent to a <em>vector field</em> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: If the tangent bundle of a manifold is trivial, the manifold is said to be <em>parallelizable</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> The circle <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> is parallelizable.</p>
<p><em>Proof</em> Let <span class="math inline">\(M = S^1\)</span>, then there is a rank 1 vector bundle<br>
<span class="math display">\[\RR \to TM \to M\]</span> and since <span class="math inline">\(TM = S^1 \cross \RR\)</span> (why?), we find that <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> is parallelizable. <span class="math inline">\(\qed\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> The sphere <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span> is not parallelizable.</p>
<p><em>Proof</em>: Let <span class="math inline">\(M = S^2\)</span>, which is associated to the rank 2 vector bundle <span class="math display">\[\RR^2 \to TM \to M\]</span></p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> is trivial iff there are 2 independent global sections. Since there is a zero section, a second independent section must be everywhere-nonzero - however, this would be a nowhere vanishing vector field on <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>, which by the Hairy Ball theorem does not exist.</p>
<p>Alternate proof: such a vector field would allow a homotopy between the identity and the antipodal map on <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>, contradiction by basic homotopy theory.<span class="math inline">\(\qed\)</span></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="classifying-spaces">Classifying Spaces</h1>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>principal <span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span>bundle</em> is a fiber bundle <span class="math inline">\(F \to E \to B\)</span> in which for each fiber <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}(b)\definedas F_b\)</span>, satisfying the condition that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> acts freely and transitively on <span class="math inline">\(F_b\)</span>. In other words, there is a continuous group action <span class="math inline">\(\actson: E\cross G \to E\)</span> such that for every <span class="math inline">\(f \in F_b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\in G\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(g\actson f \in F_b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\actson f \neq f\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A covering space <span class="math inline">\(\hat X \mapsvia{p} X\)</span> yields a principal <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(X)\dash\)</span>bundle.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: A consequence of this is that each <span class="math inline">\(F_b \cong G \in \text{TopGrp}\)</span> (which may also be taken as the definition). Furthermore, each <span class="math inline">\(F_b\)</span> is then a <em>homogeneous space</em>, i.e.&#xA0;a space with a transitive group action <span class="math inline">\(G\actson F_b\)</span> making <span class="math inline">\(F_b \cong G/G_x\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Although each fiber <span class="math inline">\(F_b\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, there is no preferred identity element in <span class="math inline">\(F_b\)</span>. Locally, one can form a local section by choosing some <span class="math inline">\(e\in F_b\)</span> to serve as the identity, but the fibers can only be given a global group structure iff the bundle is trivial. This property is expressed by saying <span class="math inline">\(F_b\)</span> is a <em><span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span>torsor</em>.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Every fiber bundle <span class="math inline">\(F\to E\to B\)</span> is a principal <span class="math inline">\(\Aut(F)\dash\)</span>fiber bundle. Also, in local trivializations, the transition functions are elements of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition</strong>: A principal bundle is trivial iff it admits a global section. Thus all principal vector bundles are trivial, since the zero section always exists.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A principal bundle <span class="math inline">\(F \to E \mapsvia{\pi} B\)</span> is <em>universal</em> iff <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is weakly contractible, i.e.&#xA0;if <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> has the homotopy type of a point.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Given a topological group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, a <em>classifying space</em>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>, is the base space of a universal principal <span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span>bundle <span class="math display">\[
G \to EG \mapsvia{\pi} BG
\]</span> making <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> a quotient of the contractible space <span class="math inline">\(EG\)</span> by a <span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span>action. We shall refer to this as <em>the classifying bundle</em>.</p>
<p>Classifying spaces satisfy the property that any other principal <span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span>bundle over a space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is isomorphic to a pullback of the classifying bundle along a map <span class="math inline">\(X \to BG\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(I(G, X)\)</span> denote the set of isomorphism classes of principal <span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span>bundles over a base space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[
I(G, X) \cong [X, BG]_{\text{hoTop}}
\]</span></p>
<p>So in other words, isomorphism classes of principal <span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span>bundles over a base <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are equivalent to homotopy classes of maps from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> into the classifying space of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition</strong>: Grassmannians are classifying spaces for vector bundles. That is, there is a bijective correspondence:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
[X, \Gr(n, \RR)] \cong \theset{\text{isomorphism classes of rank $n$ $\RR\dash$vector bundles over $X$}}
\]</span></p>
<p>It is also the case that every such vector bundle is a pullback of the principal bundle <span class="math display">\[
\GL(n, \RR) \to V_n(\RR^\infty) \to \Gr(n, \RR)
\]</span></p>
<h1 id="representing-kg-n-geometrically">Representing <span class="math inline">\(K(G, n)\)</span> Geometrically</h1>
<p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week151.html">(Summary of full material found here)</a></p>
<p>Starting with a low-dimensional example, using the fact that <span class="math inline">\(K(\ZZ, 2) = \CP^\infty = \varinjlim \CP^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>We want to make this into an abelian topological group, so let <span class="math display">\[
X = \theset{\CC \to \CC \mid f~\text{is rational}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that as a vector space, this is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\CC^\infty\)</span>, and there is a way to topologize <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> such that this is a homeomorphism as well.</p>
<p>Then let <span class="math display">\[
\hat X = \theset{f \in X \mid f~\text{is nonzero}} / \theset{f = \lambda f \mid \lambda \in \CC^*}
\]</span></p>
<p>which is the set of rational, nonzero, complex functions, modulo multiplication by constants. This is the &#x201C;projectivization&#x201D; of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\CP^\infty\)</span> as abelian topological groups.</p>
<p>Then every function <span class="math inline">\(f\in \hat X\)</span> has (say) <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> zeros and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> poles, which corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(n+m\)</span> points in <span class="math inline">\(\CC \cup \infty = \CP^1 = S^2\)</span>. If we attach an integer to every point, we can encode the difference between zeros and poles while simultaneously encoding their orders. So we then define</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_n = \theset{\theset{(z_i, k_i)}_{i=1}^n \mid \sum_{i=1}^n k_i = 0}\subset \CP^1 \cross \ZZ
\]</span></p>
<p>in which each element is a collections of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> points on the Riemann sphere, each with an integer attached, such that these integers sum to zero.</p>
<p>Then any rational complex function <span class="math inline">\(f: \CC \to \CC\)</span> with a total of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> combined zeros and poles can be uniquely recovered as some <span class="math inline">\(y\in Y_n\)</span>, so we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat X \cong \union_{n=1}^\infty Y_n
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, we perform the following procedure: each rational function has a finite number of zeros and poles, so we imagine these as points on the Riemann sphere, each with an integer attached such that the sum of these integers equals zero.</p>
<p>Then, we imagine wiggling these functions continuously - this induces movement of the points on the sphere. When any two points coincide, they &#x201C;coalesce&#x201D; and their corresponding integer labels are added together.</p>
<p>We thus envision points in <span class="math inline">\(K(\ZZ, 2) = CP^\infty\)</span> as collections of &#x201C;particle-antiparticle&#x201D; swarms on the <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>:</p>

<li>First, replace <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(S^n\)</span> to obtain a corresponding picture for <span class="math inline">\(K(\ZZ, n)\)</span></li>
<li>Then, replace <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span> with an arbitrary abelian group. We then require that the aggregate word formed by all of the points multiples to the identity, and that coalescing corresponds to multiplication of elements.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A characteristic class is a way of associating to each principal bundle X a cohomology class of X. The cohomology class measures the extent the bundle is &#x201C;twisted&#x201D; &#x2014; and whether it possesses sections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Characteristic numbers solve the oriented and unoriented bordism questions: two manifolds are (respectively oriented or unoriented) cobordant if and only if their characteristic numbers are equal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the theory was put on an organised basis around 1950 (with the definitions reduced to homotopy theory) it became clear that the most fundamental characteristic classes known at that time (the Stiefel&#x2013;Whitney class, the Chern class, and the Pontryagin classes) were reflections of the classical linear groups and their maximal torus structure.</p>

<h1 id="why-study-cobordism">Why study cobordism?</h1>

<p>Geometrically, finitely generated projective modules correspond to vector bundles over affine space, and free modules to trivial vector bundles. Affine space is topologically contractible, so It admits no non-trivial topological vector bundles. It also admits no non-trivial holomorphic vector bundles.

<p>Computing various homological invariants of associative algebras (such as Tor and Ext of various modules, Hochschild (co)homology, cyclic homology etc.) has been an active research topic in ring theory for many years. More recently (about 15 years ago), ring theorists became interested in associative algebras up to homotopy, or A&#x221E;-algebras, as a recipe to produce meaningful &#x201C;higher structures&#x201D; on classical objects like Yoneda Ext-algebras.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This offers two different perspectives on associative algebras: homological invariants are &#x201C;Abelian&#x201D; (i. e. arise when one works with additive categories, e.g.&#xA0;chain complexes of modules over a ring), while homotopical invariants are &#x201C;non-Abelian&#x201D; (i. e. arise from non-additive categories, like the category of all differential graded associative algebras). However, these two perspectives are closely related, and it is often possible to recover homological information from the homotopical one, and the other way round. For experts in homotopical algebra on a larger scale (beyond the associative ring theory), this philosophy is already present in works of Stasheff and Hinich on homotopy algebras.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Hochschild homology of an <span class="math inline">\(R\dash R\dash\)</span>bimodule reflects some ring-theoretic stuff. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(H_1(R,R)\)</span> of a <span class="math inline">\(k\dash\)</span>algebra <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the module of differentials <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_R/k\)</span>.

<p>Taking the above example further if <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a ring and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> a simplicial set, the cyclic homology (Hochschild homology taking into account a cyclic action on the corresponding simplicial set) of the simplicial module <span class="math inline">\(k[X]\)</span> is the same as the <span class="math inline">\(S_1\dash\)</span>equivariant homology of the geometric realization of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with coefficients in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>

<p>The algebraic K-groups of a scheme X are defined by producing a spectrum K(X) and setting <span class="math inline">\(K^n(X) \definedas &#x3C0;_{-n}K(X)\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be warned that K-theorists and geometers write <span class="math inline">\(K_n(X)\)</span> for our <span class="math inline">\(K^{&#x2212;n}(X)\)</span> &#x2013; we will stick to homotopy-theoretic notation, however.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>K can be defined so that it actually gives a contravariant functor (Schemes) &#x2192; (Spectra), and so the groups <span class="math inline">\(K^n(X)\)</span> do indeed start to look like a cohomology theory. For X a topological space, the analogue of K(X) turns out to be the mapping spectrum <span class="math inline">\(bu^X\)</span>, where bu is the spectrum representing complex connective K-theory (so that <span class="math inline">\(bu\)</span> is the connective cover of the spectrum <span class="math inline">\(BU\)</span>).</p>
<p>Thus, the functor K can be thought of as a substitute for the spectrum bu &#x2013; it is sort of a device for storing all the same information that bu provides, but without an honest &#x2018;space&#x2019; to house it in.</p>
<p>Most of the important results about algebraic K-theory arise from the study of the spectrum K(X), rather than that of the disembodied abelian groups <span class="math inline">\(K^n(X)\)</span>. For example, if the scheme X is covered by two open sets U and V , one wants a Mayer-Vietoris sequence <span class="math display">\[
\cdots \rightarrow K ^ { n } ( X ) \rightarrow K ^ { n } ( U ) \oplus K ^ { n } ( V ) \rightarrow K ^ { n } ( U \cap V ) \rightarrow K ^ { n + 1 } ( X ) \rightarrow \cdots
\]</span></p>
<p>This follows formally once one proves the stronger result that <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> is a homotopy pullback diagram.</p>
<p>Our first guess is motivated by the hypothesis that a contravariant functor <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> : (Schemes) &#x2192; (Spectra), in analogy to the functor <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, should look like a cohomology theory. A weak equivalence of schemes <span class="math inline">\(X \to Y\)</span> would be expected to have the property that <span class="math inline">\(E(Y ) &#x2192; E(X)\)</span> is a weak equivalence of spectra for every such <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<p>Believing that this gives the &#x2018;correct&#x2019; definition of weak equivalence reduces to believing that the whole homotopy theory of schemes is captured in the two basic facts that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{hocolim}~U_\wait \longrightarrow X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X \cross I \to X\)</span> are weak equivalences. The surprising answer is yes. If we use this definition in the case of reasonable topological spaces (like CW-complexes) we do recover the usual notion of weak equivalence. It says that the homotopy-theory of topological spaces can indeed be &#x2018;generated&#x2019; by these two fundamental properties.</p>
<p>The problem is that Zariski open covers don&#x2019;t tell the whole story about the homotopy-type of schemes. The first indications of this date back to Grothendieck&#x2019;s work on etale cohomology: looking at only Zariski covers makes the spectrum of a field look contractible, whereas in real life they behave more like <span class="math inline">\(K(&#x3C0;, 1)\)</span> (for example, they have nontrivial covering spaces).</p>
<p>We begin with the observation that algebraic topologists, despite what we are usually led to believe, are really not very interested in the category of topological spaces. Of course there are certain subcategories, like the category of manifolds, in which they are highly interested&#x2014;but the notion of &#x2018;topological space&#x2019; is much too broad, admitting a host of pathological objects for which the machinery of algebraic topology is simply not intended. On the other hand, categories such as topological manifolds end up being much too small for many purposes. The industrious homotopy-theorist finds himself wanting to glue manifolds together, quotient out by subspaces, divide out by group actions&#x2014;in short, take various colimits&#x2014;all of which have the disadvantage of perhaps producing something which is no longer a manifold. Gluing manifolds together might lead one to study some category of cell complexes, but of course these categories end up not being closed under colimits either. Thus, what the algebraic topologist desires is a setting in which he can study the category of manifolds (or finite complexes, if he is daring), have all small colimits at his disposal, and yet does not have to worry about the pathology that goes along with objects as diverse as topological spaces.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flipping roles, generalized cohomology theories can be studied in their own right. They come from a category called the stable homotopy category (which is much like a derived category of chain complexes), and each of them can be determined by a certain amount of data involving cohomology operations. Much of this data can be recovered by looking at how the generalized cohomology theory behaves on certain spaces (projective spaces and classifying spaces being the canonical examples).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After a lot of hard work (with some of the bigger names including Adams, Milnor, and Quillen, though I am leaving a lot of important names out) it is discovered, starting from almost pure calculation, that the stable homotopy category has a connection to the category of 1-dimensional formal groups, via the study of characteristic classes. Each generalized cohomology theory determines some amount of formal group data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>via things like BP-theory and the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, leads to better qualitative understanding of the stable homotopy category, new guesses about what phenomena can occur (e.g.&#xA0;the Ravenel conjectures), new techniques which are computationally useful, and new theorems (e.g.&#xA0;the solution of most of the Ravenel conjectures).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a look at Machlachlan and Reid&#x2019;s book &#x201C;The Arithmetic of Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds&#x201D;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since finite volume hyperbolic structures are unique whenever an n-manifold (n&#x2265;3) has them, any invariants of the hyperbolic structure are invariants of the manifold. Hyperbolic manifolds are K(&#x3C0;,1)-spaces, so they&#x2019;re not just diffeo/homeomorphism invariants, but invariants of the homotopy-type.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the whole field of anabelian geometry fits the bill, even if it&#x2019;s perhaps more focused on going the other way around (i.e.&#xA0;applying homotopy theory to number theory). Anabelian geometry is a &#x2018;program&#x2019; launched by Grothendieck in his famous Esquisse d&#x2019;un Programme, and is all about translating arithmetic geometric problems to problems in homotopy theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As an example of a specific instance of the anabelian philosophy, we have Grothendieck&#x2019;s celebrated &#x2018;section conjecture&#x2019;, which states (in one form) that for a &#x2018;nice&#x2019; curve X over a number field F, the rational points are in bijection with the sections of the exact sequence <span class="math display">\[
1 \rightarrow \pi_1(X_{\bar{F}}) \rightarrow \pi_1(X) \rightarrow G_F \rightarrow 1
\]</span> where GF is the absolute Galois group of F and &#x3C0;1 is the algebraic (etale) fundamental group. In case the curve is over the complex numbers, the etale &#x3C0;1 is the profinite completion of the regular fundamental group, so there is a very close connection to the classical stuff of Hatcher. The conjecture is still a wide open problem, but any proof would mean you could check something of number theoretic interest (existence of rational points on curves) by studying maps between certain generalized homotopy groups!</p>

<p>Neat trick from algebraic geometry: For a stack <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal M =X/G\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(\CC\dash\)</span>variety and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a finite group, then <span class="math display">\[
H^\wait(\mathcal M; \QQ) \cong \left( H^\wait(X; \QQ)\right)^G
\]</span> where the RHS denotes the taking the <span class="math inline">\(G\dash\)</span> invariant part. Seems to only work over <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span>. The quotient is scheme-theoretic. The actual definite involves equivariant cohomology.</p>
<p>Prototypical example of a moduli space: <span class="math inline">\(\Gr_\CC(n, k)\)</span>. Apparently fundamental classes exist for closed subvarieties? Maybe just closed subvarieties of a moduli space.</p>

<p>The point of this note is to reword and fill in some details in <a href="https://amathew.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/eilenberg-maclane-spaces/amp/">Akhil Mathew&#x2019;s post</a> # The Setup {#the-setup }</p>
<p>We start with a very general problem: suppose we are given a topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and wish to compute <span class="math inline">\(\pi_*(X)\)</span>. Although the homotopy groups themselves are not a complete invariant of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> &#x2013; that is, we can generally construct spaces that are homotopy-equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> but not homeomorphic &#x2013; this will get us partially there. Moreover, in this process we will determine what extra information is needed to in fact obtain a <em>complete</em> set of invariants for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>The very first thing we&#x2019;ll do is replace <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with a CW complex that is homotopy-equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. By the CW approximation theorem, we can do this for any space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and since many theorems are much nicer for CW complexes than arbitrary spaces, we implicitly work in this subcategory from here on.</p>
<p>For any group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, suppose for a moment that there existed a space <span class="math inline">\(K(G,n)\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a natural numbers) satisfying <span class="math display">\[
\pi_i(K(G,n)) = \begin{cases}
G, &amp; i = n \\
0, &amp; \text{else}
\end{cases}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> denotes the trivial group. If such a space existed, this would perhaps be the simplest type of object to work with within homotopy theory &#x2013; it has exactly one homotopy group concentrated in one dimension. We will show later that not only does such a space exist, and can be constructed in a relatively straightforward manner, but also that it is unique up to homotopy-equivalence, and are thus referred to as <em>Eilenberg-MacLane spaces</em>.</p>
<h1 id="the-atoms-of-homotopy-theory">The Atoms of Homotopy Theory</h1>
<p>For the moment, let&#x2019;s focus on one particular degree on homotopy groups, say <span class="math inline">\(G = \pi_i(X)\)</span>. Note that for our original space, if we make the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is finitely generated, we can appeal to the classification of (finitely generated) abelian groups and write <span class="math inline">\(G \cong \ZZ^n \bigoplus_{j=1}^m \ZZ_{k_j}\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and some <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. That is, it decomposes as a free group of rank <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, along with a sum of finite cyclic groups with orders given by the invariant factors <span class="math inline">\(k_j\)</span>. As an aside, it is perhaps worth mentioning that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_i(X)\)</span> is abelian for <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span>, so the categorical product and coproduct (here the direct sum) will coincide. This leaves the <span class="math inline">\(i=1\)</span> case; however, the fundamental group can generally be computed using more elementary methods such as covering space theory and Van Kampen&#x2019;s theorem.</p>
<p>So we&#x2019;ve come up with the &#x201C;atoms&#x201D; that we might hope to build spaces out of, and we&#x2019;ve realized that we can break any given homotopy group of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> into free and cyclic groups. The strategy now is to see if we can work out what kind of spaces <span class="math inline">\(K(\ZZ^n, i)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K(\ZZ_k, i)\)</span> are, and hope we can prove a theorem that says something like <span class="math inline">\(K(G_1, i) \oplus K(G_2, i) =K(G_1 \oplus G_2, i)\)</span>. If we can do this, we now have a method of constructing a space that has the same homotopy groups as <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in degree <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. If we can then show something like <span class="math display">\[
\pi_i(K(G_1, j) \oplus K(G_2, k)) = \begin{cases}
G_1, &amp; i = j \\
G_2, &amp; i = k \\
0, &amp; \text{else}
\end{cases}
\]</span> then we will be in business. Explicitly, splitting the homotopy groups of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> up by degree and writing <span class="math display">\[\pi_*(X) = \bigoplus_{i=1}^\infty \pi_i(X),\]</span> we could construct a space <span class="math inline">\(X&apos;\)</span> that has the exact same homotopy groups <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by taking <span class="math display">\[X&apos; = \bigoplus_{i=1}^\infty K(\pi_i(X), i).\]</span></p>
<p>What does this buy us? It&#x2019;s not quite the case that <span class="math inline">\(X&apos; \homotopic X\)</span>, since having isomorphic homotopy groups alone is insufficient to guarantee homotopy equivalence. A standard counterexample here are the spaces <span class="math inline">\(S^2\cross \RP^3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S^3 \cross \RP^2\)</span>; one in fact needs a single map <em>inducing</em> all of the isomorphisms on homotopy groups simultaneously for this kind of result to hold.</p>
<p>So the naive hope of writing <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as a product of simple spaces won&#x2019;t work. As it turns out, what we <em>can</em> get is a way to write <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in a way that&#x2019;s often referred to as a &#x201C;twisted&#x201D; product, which is formalized in the notion of a (Serre) fibration.</p>
<h1 id="twisted-products">Twisted Products</h1>
<p>It&#x2019;s perhaps worth spelling out exactly what &#x201C;twisted product&#x201D; means here, since it&#x2019;s often glossed over. Suppose we have a fibration <span class="math inline">\(F \injects E \mapsvia{p} B\)</span> which is in fact a fiber bundle &#x2013; note that this is a strictly stronger condition, requiring the fibration to have <em>local trivialization</em>. This amounts to asking that for every open neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U \in B\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(p^{-1}(B) = F \cross B\)</span> up to homeomorphism. This is of course strictly weaker than requiring <span class="math inline">\(E\cong F\cross B\)</span> globally, which would be denoted a trivial bundle; there may in fact be monodromy in the total space <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> that topologically distinguishes it from this product. A primary example of this phenomenon is the Mobius bundle, <span class="math display">\[
I \injects M \surjects S^1
\]</span></p>
<p>which is a line bundle over the circle. Note that locally we do have <span class="math inline">\(M \cong S^1 \cross I\)</span>, but since <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is not homeomorphic to a cylinder, this produces a nontrivial bundle. There is instead a global &#x201C;twist&#x201D;, arising from the fact <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is nonorientable and parallel-transporting a small arc in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> once around the core circle is not the identity map. By a somewhat non-precise abuse of notation, one might instead write something like <span class="math inline">\(M \cong S^1 \semidirect_\varphi I\)</span>, indicating that this is a nontrivial bundle. One could further ask, given a base <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and a fiber <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, how many distinct nontrivial bundles <span class="math inline">\(F \to E \to B\)</span> exist, which is a bit far afield for us now but leads to the rich and fruitful theory classifying spaces.</p>
<p>The moral of the story here is that we can generalize a product of spaces <span class="math inline">\(A \times B \times C \times \cdots\)</span> as a &#x201C;twisted product&#x201D; <span class="math inline">\(A \semidirect_{\varphi_1} B \semidirect_{\varphi_1} C \semidirect_{\varphi_1} \cdots\)</span> by constructing an interlocking series of fibrations. Luckily for us, our next step towards solving our original problem will involve the construction of Postnikov towers, which explicitly encode how this interlocking works.</p>
<h1 id="postnikov-towers-1">Postnikov Towers</h1>
<p>First I want to define exactly what a Postnikov tower is and how we can explicitly build them using CW complexes, since this is something that is treated differently among different sources.</p>
<p>The data is a Postnikov tower is a sequence of spaces <span class="math inline">\(\theset{X_i}\)</span> equipped with maps <span class="math inline">\(p_n: X_n \to X_{n-1}\)</span>, where each <span class="math inline">\(p_n\)</span> is a fibration, and <span class="math display">\[
\pi_i(X_n) =
\begin{cases}
\pi_i(X), &amp; i \leq n \\
0, &amp; i &gt; n.

It also turns out there is a weak equivalence <span class="math inline">\(X \to \lim_i X_i\)</span>, and so carrying this out inductively allows us to write <span class="math display">\[

<p>yielding our &#x201C;twisted product&#x201D;.</p>
<p>This spaces can be constructed by a relatively easy process. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> already has the homotopy type of a <span class="math inline">\(CW\)</span> complex, first let <span class="math inline">\(X_i = X^{(i)}\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(i\dash\)</span>skeleton of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Since every group has a presentation, we can write <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{i+1}(X) = \generators{a, b, c, \cdots} / \generators{R_1, R_2, \cdots}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,\cdots\)</span> are generators and <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> are relations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~mbehren1/papers/exotic2.pdf">Behrens Hopkins Hill</a> A homotopy n-sphere is a smooth n-manifold which is homotopy equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(S^n\)</span>. Kervaire and Milnor defined &#x398;n to be the group of homotopy spheres up to h-cobordism (where the group operation is given by connect sum). By the h-cobordism theorem [Sma62] (n &gt; 4) and Perelman&#x2019;s proof of the Poincare conjecture [Per02], [Per03a], [Per03b] (n = 3), for n 6= 4, &#x398;n = 0 if and only if <span class="math inline">\(S^n\)</span> has a unique differentiable structure (i.e.&#xA0;there are no exotic spheres of dimension n).</p>
<p>We wish to consider the following question: For which n is &#x398;n = 0?</p>
<p>The general belief is that there should be finitely many such n, and these n should be concentrated in relatively low dimensions.</p>
<p>The chromatic tower. Fix a prime p.&#xA0;The chromatic tower of a spectrum X is the tower of Bousfield localizations <span class="math display">\[
X \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow X _ { E ( n ) } \rightarrow X _ { E ( n - 1 ) } \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow X _ { E ( 0 ) }

E ( n ) _ { * } = \mathbb { Z } _ { ( p ) } \left[ v _ { 1 } , \dots , v _ { n - 1 } , v _ { n } ^ { \pm } \right]
\]</span> The fibers of the chromatic tower <span class="math display">\[
M _ { n } X \rightarrow X _ { E ( n ) } \rightarrow X _ { E ( n - 1 ) }

<p>Let Mell denote the Deligne-Mumford stack of elliptic curves (over Spec(Z)). For a commutative ring R, the groupoid of R-points of Mell is the groupoid of elliptic curves over R. This stack carries a line bundle &#x3C9; where for an elliptic curve C, the fiber of &#x3C9; over C is given by <span class="math display">\[&#x3C9;C = T^&#x2217;_e C,\]</span> the tangent space of C at its basepoint e. The stack <span class="math inline">\(M_{ell}\)</span> admits a compactification <span class="math inline">\(\overline{M}_{ell}\)</span> whose R points are generalized elliptic curves. The space of integral modular forms of weight k is defined to be the sections <span class="math display">\[
H ^ { 0 } \left( \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { e l l } , \omega ^ { \otimes k } \right)
\]</span> Motivated by the definition of integral modular forms and this descent spectral sequence in the case of U = Mell , the spectrum Tmf is defined to be the global sections <span class="math display">\[
\mathrm { Tmf } : = \mathcal { O } ^ { t o p } \left( \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { e l l } \right)
\]</span></p>
<p>What we want to represent is <span class="math inline">\(SO(3, \RR)\)</span>, where a real representation of a group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a map <span class="math inline">\(G \to \GL(n, \RR)\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. More generally, we can define a <span class="math inline">\(V\dash\)</span>representation as a map <span class="math inline">\(G \to \Aut(V)\)</span>, where since <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> lives in the category of vector spaces, this amounts to requiring that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> maps to a linear map. Equivalently we can ask for a <span class="math inline">\(V\dash\)</span>linear map <span class="math inline">\(G\cross V \to V\)</span> (i.e.&#xA0;a group action on <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>).</p>
<p>So the goal is to construct a representation <span class="math inline">\(f: SO(3, \RR)) \to \GL(n, \RR)\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose we are working with Euler angles <span class="math display">\[E \definedas \theset{ (\phi, \theta, \psi) \suchthat \phi,\psi \in [0, 2\pi], \theta \in [0,\pi]} / \sim\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(2\pi \phi \sim \phi, 2\pi\psi \sim \psi, \pi\psi\sim\psi\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can then cook up a representation <span class="math inline">\(g: E \to \GL(n, \RR)\)</span> by writing down appropriate rotation matrices in the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\phi, \theta, \psi\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R = \left[ \begin{array} { c c c } { 1 } &amp; { 0 } &amp; { 0 } \\ { 0 } &amp; { \cos \alpha } &amp; { - \sin \alpha } \\ { 0 } &amp; { \sin \alpha } &amp; { \cos \alpha } \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array} { c c c } { \cos \beta } &amp; { 0 } &amp; { \sin \beta } \\ { 0 } &amp; { 1 } &amp; { 0 } \\ { - \sin \beta } &amp; { 0 } &amp; { \cos \beta } \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array} { c c c } { \cos \gamma } &amp; { - \sin \gamma } &amp; { 0 } \\ { \sin \gamma } &amp; { \cos \gamma } &amp; { 0 } \\ { 0 } &amp; { 0 } &amp; { 1 } \end{array} \right] = = \left[ \begin{array} { c c c } { 0 } &amp; { 0 } &amp; { 1 } \\ { \sin ( \alpha + \gamma ) } &amp; { \cos ( \alpha + \gamma ) } &amp; { 0 } \\ { - \cos ( \alpha + \gamma ) } &amp; { \sin ( \alpha + \gamma ) } &amp; { 0 } \end{array} \right]
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that each angle lives in a real interval with the endpoints identified, which is topologically a circle. So, up to homeomorphism, we have <span class="math inline">\(E \cong S^1 \cross S^1 \cross S^1 = (S^1)^3 = T^3\)</span>, a real 3-torus. The question then becomes whether or not the representation we are looking for, say <span class="math inline">\(SO(3, \RR) \to \GL(n, \RR)\)</span>, factors through the representation <span class="math inline">\(E\ to \GL(n, \RR)\)</span> that we have cooked up. This amounts to asking if there is a map <span class="math inline">\(h: \SO^3 \to T^3\)</span> that makes the following diagram commute:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{tikzcd}
T^3 \arrow[rrdd, &quot;g&quot;]                                       &amp;  &amp;                              \\
                                                            &amp;  &amp;                              \\
{SO(3, \mathbb{R})} \arrow[rr, &quot;f&quot;] \arrow[dd, &quot;h&quot;, dashed] &amp;  &amp; {\mathrm{Gl}(n, \mathbb{R})}
\end{tikzcd}
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, can we factor the complicated representation <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that we want through a simpler representation <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>? In order for this to be a fully faithful representation, this amounts to asking if we can replace <span class="math inline">\(SO(3, \RR)\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> up to isomorphism in some category.</p>
<p>In particular, we should ask that this diagram preserves all of the structure we care about. Since we are viewing everything in sight as a smooth topological group, we should ask that all maps be continuous group homomorphisms.</p>
<p>In particular, we would want <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> to be a homeomorphism &#x2013; however, something has already gone awry, because this is not the case. Perhaps the easiest way to see this is by considering fundamental groups. Topologically, we have <span class="math inline">\(\SO(3, \RR) \cong \RP^3\)</span> and in particular <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(\RP^3) \cong \ZZ/2\ZZ\)</span>. However, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(T^3) \cong \ZZ^3\)</span>, and so these spaces are not homeomorphic.</p>
<p>We might instead ask that <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> be a covering map, so that <span class="math inline">\(T^3\)</span> covers <span class="math inline">\(\SO(3, \RR)\)</span> in some sufficiently nice way instead. It turns out that such a surjective map can be constructed, but from the above discussion, we know that injectivity will have to fail, and it is this phenomenon which introduces the singularities that result in gimbal lock. When writing out such a map, this singular points will be to coordinates at which the map will be less than full rank, and fail to be a local homeomorphism in neighborhoods of these points.</p>
<p>To explicitly construct such a map, we&#x2019;ll identify <span class="math inline">\(SO(3, \RR)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\RP^3\)</span> and look for a map <span class="math inline">\(h&apos;: T^3 \to \RP^3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Nix that, we&#x2019;ll actually want to look at all possible covers of <span class="math inline">\(\RP^3\)</span>. One such covering space is <span class="math inline">\(S^3\)</span>, where the covering map is given by identifying antipodal points.</p>
<p>Definition [Hatcher]: For a topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, a covering space of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a space <span class="math inline">\(\tilde X\)</span> and a map <span class="math inline">\(p: \tilde X \to X\)</span> such that for each point <span class="math inline">\(x\in X\)</span>, there exists an open neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U_x\subet X\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p^{-1}i(U_x) = \coprod \tilde{U}_x\)</span> such that each <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{U}_x\)</span> is homeomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(U_x\)</span>, where the homeomorphism is realized by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>One fact we can use here is that if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a covering map, then the induced map on fundamental groups <span class="math inline">\(p_*: \tilde X \to X\)</span> is an injection. Since we are taking <span class="math inline">\(X = \RP^3\)</span> here and we know <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(\RP^3) = \ZZ/2\ZZ\)</span>, we can narrow our search a bit by asking what groups <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> can fit into an injective group homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(G \to \ZZ/2\ZZ\)</span>. This narrows our choices for <span class="math inline">\(\tilde X\)</span> considerably, since this forces <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(\tilde X) = \ZZ/2\ZZ\text{ or }0\)</span>. This immediately excludes <span class="math inline">\(T^3\)</span> from being a possibility, since <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(T^3) = \ZZ^3\)</span> and an infinite group can&#x2019;t be injected into a finite group.</p>
<p>We can in fact instead appeal to the classification of covering spaces, which says that there is a Galois correspondence between covering spaces of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and subgroups of <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(X)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ/2\ZZ\)</span> has exactly two subgroups, <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ/2\ZZ\)</span>, this leaves us with exactly two choices. The identity map <span class="math inline">\(\RP^2 \to \RP^2\)</span> yields the covering space corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ/2\ZZ\)</span>, and the remaining choice can be realized by taking <span class="math inline">\(S^3 \mapsvia{p} \RP^2\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p(\vector{x}) = [x_1, x_2, x_3]\)</span> in homogeneous coordinates. Topologically, noting that <span class="math display">\[p(-\vector x) = [-x_1, -x_2, -x_3] = [x_1, x_2, x_3],\]</span></p>
<p>which follows from the identity <span class="math inline">\([x,y, \cdots] = [\lambda x, \lambda y, \cdots]\)</span> for any scalar <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> in projective spaces, we find that this map is realized by taking points on the sphere and identifying them with their antipodes.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(S^3) = 0\)</span>, the induced map <span class="math inline">\(p_*(\pi_1(S^3)) \to \pi_1(\RP^3)\)</span> will be the zero map, and thus <span class="math inline">\(p_*(\pi_1(S^3)) = 0\)</span> and we obtain the second possible covering space. This can also be seen from the fact that <span class="math inline">\(S^3\)</span> is simply connected, so <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(S^3) = 0\)</span>, and thus <span class="math inline">\(S^3\)</span> is the universal cover of <span class="math inline">\(\RP^3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Of particular importance here is the fact that the only possibilities for covers were <span class="math inline">\(S^3\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\RP^3\)</span> itself. We know that <span class="math inline">\(\RP^3 \not\cong T^3\)</span> by looking at fundamental groups; we can also find that <span class="math inline">\(S^3 \not\cong T^3\)</span> by looking at <span class="math inline">\(\pi_3\)</span>. In particular, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(S^3) = 0\)</span> while <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(T^3) = \ZZ^3\)</span>. So there can not exist a covering map <span class="math inline">\(T^3 \to \RP^3\)</span>, which means that any such map we construct must fail the local homeomorphic mapping condition in a neighborhood of at least one point.</p>
<p>So let&#x2019;s attempt to define such a map and see what goes wrong. Since <span class="math inline">\(T^3 = S^1 \cross S^1 \cross S^1\)</span>, let a coordinate on the torus be given by <span class="math inline">\((\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3)\)</span> where each <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i \in [0, \2pi)\)</span>. Inspired by how nicely the previous map <span class="math inline">\(S^3 \to \RP^3\)</span> worked, let us first define <span class="math display">\[p: \T^3 \to \RP^3 \\ (\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3) \mapsto [\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3]\]</span> Since we hope to represent all elements of <span class="math inline">\(SO(3,\RR)\)</span> in this way, we want a surjective map.</p>

<p>Participate in research groups: If you are a new graduate student in your department, I recommend that you contact your department chair, coordinator, advisor, and graduate studies chair to ask them about any available research groups to join so you can participate in the group&#x2019;s research publications and seminar&#x2019;s talks.</p>
<p>At the end of the talk, you should try to answer the questions: What question(s) is the speaker trying to answer? Why should we care about them? What flavor of results has the speaker proved? Do I have a small example of the phenomenon under discussion? You can even scribble down these questions at the start of the talk, and jot down answers to them during the talk.</p>
<p>Try to extract three words from the talk (no matter how tangentially related to the subject at hand) that you want to know the definition of.</p>
<p>Try to ask one question at as many seminars as possible, either during the talk, or privately afterwards. The act of trying to formulating an interesting question (for you, not the speaker!) is a worthwhile exercise, and can focus the mind.</p>
<p>Courses and reading courses. During the first year, you will be taking many courses, some required. In the Winter and Spring terms, try to set up a reading course with other graduate students in an area that you are interested in knowing more about.</p>
<p>However, you should be able to answer the following questions at the end of any seminar: &#x201C;What is the major theorem or question that the speaker is approaching?&#x201D; &#x201C;Why is he or she interested in this question or theorem?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Summer research. Do a research project with your potential advisor over the summer. At least once every two weeks, write down what you have learned (from papers, books, conversations) or discovered (through your hard and persistent work). Keep this in a place that you will be able to refer to later</p>
<p>Ideally, you should have a preprint out by spring of Year n-1. If you do, or you are close, then begin talking to the people that you&#x2019;ve met at conferences about speaking at their schools&#x2019; research seminars.</p>
<p>What if you are interested in liberal arts jobs? If you think it is a possibility that you will want to take a liberal arts job or teaching job after you graduate, then attend the Joint Math Meetings and begin meeting people from the types of schools you are considering a job at.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Co-author a paper with someone who has more experience. Approach a professor who is working on an interesting project and offer your services in return for a junior authorship. He&#x2019;ll appreciate the help and will give you lots of good comments on the paper because his name will be on it.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="advisory-relationship">Advisory Relationship</h1>
<p>You should have a discussion with your advisor very early on about your career goals. By this, I mean, you should talk openly about whether or not you are planning to pursue a tenure-track research position, a teaching position at a SLAC (small, liberal arts college), an &#x201C;alt-ac&#x201D; career in industry, or any other goal.</p>
<p>Show up to your advisory meetings with a clear agenda, starting with things that are most time-sensitive. Your advisors are busy and may not have the time to be as involved as they want to be in your life. Make it easy for them. Same with emails that you are sending out. If it&#x2019;s longer than two paragraphs: stop and delete the whole thing. Set up a meeting instead.</p>
<p>Other people&#x2019;s successes are not your failures. Try as much as possible not to compete with your peers. Don&#x2019;t undermine them, don&#x2019;t put them down, don&#x2019;t be upset when they succeed. Foster a support network, based on care and trust. Help them and they will help you. Share materials with each other, read each other&#x2019;s papers, study together. They will be your colleagues, now and forever. Success in academia hinges upon long-term collaborative interactions.</p>
<p>If you have debilitating stage fright or presentation anxiety, I would recommend talking to your doctor about whether you&#x2019;re a good candidate for beta blockers, such as propranolol.</p>

<li><p>Every lecture should make only one main point.</p>
<p>The German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel wrote that any philosopher who uses the word &#x201C;and&#x201D; too often cannot be a good philosopher. I think he was right, at least insofar as lecturing goes.</p></li>
<li><p>Every lecture should state one main point and repeat it over and over, like a theme with variations</p>
<p>As I looked through his Collected Papers, however, another picture emerged. The editors had gone out of their way to publish every little scrap Riesz had ever published. It was clear that Riesz&#x2019;s publications were few. What is more surprising is that the papers had been published several times. Riesz would publish the first rough version of an idea in some obscure Hungarian journal. A few years later he would send a series of notes to the French Academy&#x2019;s Comptes Rendus in which the same material was further elaborated. A few more years would pass, and he would publish the definitive paper, either in French or in English.</p>
<p>Adam Koranyi, who took courses with Frederick Riesz, told me that Riesz would lecture on the same subject year after year while meditating on the definitive version to be written. No wonder the final version was perfect.</p></li>
<li><p>Every Mathematician Has Only a Few Tricks</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Feynman Method</p>
<p>Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit,</p></li>
