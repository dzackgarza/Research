The most prestigious journals may be Annals of Math., Invent. Math., and the Journal of the AMS. Others of very high quality include Duke Math. J., Publ. Math. IHES, Annales de l'ENS, Math. Annalen, Compositio Math., J. reine und angew. Math., Internat. Math. Research Notices, and (though I may be biased) Algebra & Number Theory.

Participate in research groups: If you are a new graduate student in your department, I recommend that you contact your department chair, coordinator, advisor, and graduate studies chair to ask them about any available research groups to join so you can participate in the group’s research publications and seminar’s talks.

At the end of the talk, you should try to answer the questions: What question(s) is the speaker trying to answer? Why should we care about them? What flavor of results has the speaker proved? Do I have a small example of the phenomenon under discussion? You can even scribble down these questions at the start of the talk, and jot down answers to them during the talk.

Try to extract three words from the talk (no matter how tangentially related to the subject at hand) that you want to know the definition of.

Try to ask one question at as many seminars as possible, either during the talk, or privately afterwards. The act of trying to formulating an interesting question (for you, not the speaker!) is a worthwhile exercise, and can focus the mind.

Courses and reading courses. During the first year, you will be taking many courses, some required. In the Winter and Spring terms, try to set up a reading course with other graduate students in an area that you are interested in knowing more about.

However, you should be able to answer the following questions at the end of any seminar: “What is the major theorem or question that the speaker is approaching?” “Why is he or she interested in this question or theorem?”

Summer research. Do a research project with your potential advisor over the summer. At least once every two weeks, write down what you have learned (from papers, books, conversations) or discovered (through your hard and persistent work). Keep this in a place that you will be able to refer to later

Ideally, you should have a preprint out by spring of Year n-1. If you do, or you are close, then begin talking to the people that you've met at conferences about speaking at their schools' research seminars.

What if you are interested in liberal arts jobs? If you think it is a possibility that you will want to take a liberal arts job or teaching job after you graduate, then attend the Joint Math Meetings and begin meeting people from the types of schools you are considering a job at.

1. Co-author a paper with someone who has more experience. Approach a professor who is working on an interesting project and offer your services in return for a junior authorship. He’ll appreciate the help and will give you lots of good comments on the paper because his name will be on it.

# Advisory Relationship

You should have a discussion with your advisor very early on about your career goals. By this, I mean, you should talk openly about whether or not you are planning to pursue a tenure-track research position, a teaching position at a SLAC (small, liberal arts college), an “alt-ac” career in industry, or any other goal.

Show up to your advisory meetings with a clear agenda, starting with things that are most time-sensitive. Your advisors are busy and may not have the time to be as involved as they want to be in your life. Make it easy for them. Same with emails that you are sending out. If it’s longer than two paragraphs: stop and delete the whole thing. Set up a meeting instead.

Other people’s successes are not your failures. Try as much as possible not to compete with your peers. Don’t undermine them, don’t put them down, don’t be upset when they succeed. Foster a support network, based on care and trust. Help them and they will help you. Share materials with each other, read each other’s papers, study together. They will be your colleagues, now and forever. Success in academia hinges upon long-term collaborative interactions.

If you have debilitating stage fright or presentation anxiety, I would recommend talking to your doctor about whether you’re a good candidate for beta blockers, such as propranolol.

- Every lecture should make only one main point.

  The German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel wrote
  that any philosopher who uses the word “and”
  too often cannot be a good philosopher. I think
  he was right, at least insofar as lecturing goes.

- Every lecture should state one main point and repeat it over and over, like a theme with variations


  As I looked through his Collected Papers, however,
  another picture emerged. The editors had
  gone out of their way to publish every little scrap
  Riesz had ever published. It was clear that Riesz’s
  publications were few. What is more surprising
  is that the papers had been published several
  times. Riesz would publish the first rough version
  of an idea in some obscure Hungarian journal.
  A few years later he would send a series of
  notes to the French Academy’s Comptes Rendus
  in which the same material was further elaborated.
  A few more years would pass, and he
  would publish the definitive paper, either in
  French or in English.

  Adam Koranyi, who took courses with Frederick Riesz,
  told me that Riesz would lecture on
  the same subject year after year while meditating
  on the definitive version to be written. No
  wonder the final version was perfect.


- Every Mathematician Has Only a Few Tricks

- Use the Feynman Method

  Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have
  to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly
  present in your mind, although by and
  large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time
  you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test
  it against each of your twelve problems to see
  whether it helps. Every once in a while there will
  be a hit,

- Give Lavish Acknowledgments

- Write Informative Introductions

Nowadays reading a mathematics paper from top
to bottom is a rare event. If we wish our paper
to be read, we had better provide our prospective readers with strong motivation to do so. A
lengthy introduction, summarizing the history
of the subject, giving everybody his due, and perhaps enticingly outlining the content of the
paper in a discursive manner, will go some of the
way towards getting us a couple of readers.
