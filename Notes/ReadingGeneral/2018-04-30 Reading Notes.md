# Why study characteristic classes?
> A characteristic class is a way of associating to each principal bundle X a cohomology class of X. The cohomology class measures the extent the bundle is "twisted" — and whether it possesses sections.

> Characteristic numbers solve the oriented and unoriented bordism questions: two manifolds are (respectively oriented or unoriented) cobordant if and only if their characteristic numbers are equal.

> When the theory was put on an organised basis around 1950 (with the definitions reduced to homotopy theory) it became clear that the most fundamental characteristic classes known at that time (the Stiefel–Whitney class, the Chern class, and the Pontryagin classes) were reflections of the classical linear groups and their maximal torus structure.



# Why study cobordism?

>  Cobordism is a much coarser equivalence relation than diffeomorphism or homeomorphism of manifolds, and is significantly easier to study and compute. It is not possible to classify manifolds up to diffeomorphism or homeomorphism in dimensions ≥ 4 – because the word problem for groups cannot be solved – but it is possible to classify manifolds up to cobordism.

> It performed an important role, historically speaking, in developments in topology in the 1950s and early 1960s, in particular in the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, and in the first proofs of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.

> Every vector bundle theory (real, complex etc.) has an extraordinary cohomology theory called K-theory

# Why study $K$-theory?
> Examples of results gleaned from the K-theory approach include the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, Bott periodicity, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and the Adams operations.

>  It played a major role in the second proof of the Index Theorem (circa 1962).

> Already in 1955, Jean-Pierre Serre had used the analogy of vector bundles with projective modules to formulate Serre's conjecture, which states that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free;

> Geometrically, finitely generated projective modules correspond to vector bundles over affine space, and free modules to trivial vector bundles. Affine space is topologically contractible, so It admits no non-trivial topological vector bundles. It also admits no non-trivial holomorphic vector bundles. Jean-Pierre Serre remarked that the corresponding question was not known for algebraic vector bundles: "It is not known whether there exist projective A-modules of finite type which are not free." Here $A$ is a polynomial ring over a field, that is, $A$ = $k[x_1, ..., x_n]$. Theorem: every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free.

Note: another example of the use of the correspondence between isomorphism classes and cohomology
>the Picard group of a ringed space X, denoted by Pic(X), is the group of isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves (or line bundles) on X. Alternatively, the Picard group can be defined as the sheaf cohomology group $H^{1} (X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X}^{*})$.
