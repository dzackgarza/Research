# Recent Developments in Algebraic Topology

Big Theorems:
- Brouwer Fixed Point
- Division Algebras over $\RR$
- Borsuk-Ulam
- Invariance of domain
- Aatiyah-Singer Index Theorem
  - $K\dash$theory and bordism
- Brown Representability Spectrum

Opinion from MO: modern Topology starts with spectra.

Stuff to Review:
- Characteristic Classes (see Milnor)
  - Stiefel-Whitney class
  - Mapping cylinder/cone
  - Chern class
  - Euler class (or Euler bundle..? Find in old email)
- Homotopy limit/colimit
- The $J$-homomorphism
  - [See beginning of Hopkins talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix4pg87LKVk)
- $p\dash$adic stuff
- Linearly independent sections
- Normal bundle
- Tubular neighborhoods
- Resolutions
- Suspension
- Colimits
- Smash product
- Picard group (e.g. of $L_{K(n)}S^O$)
- Regular representations

Stuff to Look Into
- Kervaire Invariant 1 Problem
  - Equivariant topology
  - Chromatic homotopy theory
  - Orthogonal spectra
- Model categories
- The cobordism hypothesis
- Milnor's conjecture
- Vandiver's conjecture
- $\infty\dash$categories
- Classifying orbifolds
- $K\dash$theory
- Deformation theory
- Topological modular forms
- Riemann-Roch
- Localizations
- Completions
- Steenrod Algebra

- Local fields
- Nishida's Theorem:
  - The $S^1$ spectrum is some kind of "thickening" of $\ZZ$?

- Symplectic geometry
  - Lagrangian submanifolds
- Morava E-Theory

# Contact Geometry
> Contact geometry also has applications to low-dimensional topology; for example, it has been used by Kronheimer and Mrowka to prove the property P conjecture, by Michael Hutchings to define an invariant of smooth three-manifolds, and by Lenhard Ng to define invariants of knots. It was also used by Yakov Eliashberg to derive a topological characterization of Stein manifolds of dimension at least six.
