- Main idea: certain types of "topological field theories" are classified by certain stable homotopy classes of maps between 2 specific spectra
- Main tool: Adams spectral sequence, invented to resolve Hopf invariant one. Relates cohomology of spaces/spectra to stable homotopy
- Mod-2 cohomology of any space is a module over the Steenrod algebra
- Two important classes of isomorphisms: chain homotopy equivalences vs quasi-isomorphisms.
