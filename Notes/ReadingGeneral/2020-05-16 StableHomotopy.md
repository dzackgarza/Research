Paper: [A Guide for Computing Stable Homotopy Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07530)

- Main idea: certain types of "topological field theories" are classified by certain stable homotopy classes of maps between 2 specific spectra
- Main tool: Adams spectral sequence, invented to resolve Hopf invariant one. Relates cohomology of spaces/spectra to stable homotopy
- Mod-2 cohomology of any space is a module over the Steenrod algebra
- Two important classes of isomorphisms: chain homotopy equivalences vs quasi-isomorphisms.
  - Derived category inverts quasi-isomorphisms (not an equivalence relation!)
  - Homotopy category inverts chain homotopy equivalences. In theory, easier to do.
  - For bounded below projective chain complexes, quasi-iso implies chain homotopy equivalence, so can take derived category to be projective chain complexes with chain homotopy equivalences as morphisms
- Analogy:
  - Chain homotopy equivalences for modules $\iff$ homotopy equivalences
  - Quasi-isomorphisms $\iff$ weak homotopy equivalences
  - Derived category $\iff$ homotopy category of spectra
  - Projective chain complexes $\iff$ CW spectra
- Standard examples of spectra:
  - Suspension spectrum: for any space $X$, $$\Sigma^\infty X \definedas \qty{ X_0 \definedas X \to X_1 \definedas \Sigma X \to X_2 \definedas \Sigma^2 X \to \cdots},$$ yields a functor $\Sigma^\infty:\text{Top} \to \text{PreSpectra}$ with adjoint $\Omega^\infty$ where $X \mapsto X_0$.
  - $HG \definedas K(G, 0) \mapsvia{\omega_0^*} K(G, 1) \to \cdots$ where we take the adjoint of the homotopy equivalences $\omega_n: K(G, n) \to \OmegaK(G, n+1)$.
  - $K\dash$theory, where $K = \qty{\ZZ \cross BU \to U \to \ZZ \cross BU \to U \to \cdots}$ using the equivalences given by 2-fold Bott periodicity.
  - Real $K\dash$theory $KO = \qty{\ZZ\cross BO \to \cdots}$ using 8-fold Bott periodicity.
  - Any infinite loop space $X= X_0$, i.e. where $X \homotopic \Omega^k X_k$, then take $X_0 \to X_1 \to \cdots$.
  - Function spectrum $F(X, Y) = ?$.
- Coproduct in $\text{Top}_*$ is wedge
- $\text{Top}_*$ is a closed symmetric monoidal category, where the symmetric monoidal product is the smash product $A \smash B$ for which there is a homeomorphism $\hom_\top(A\smash B, C) \cong \hom_\top(A, \hom_\top(B, C))$.
- Alternate definition of hoTop/DTop as localizing equivalence: initial category receiving a functor which sends blah equivalences to isomorphisms 
- The "usual" category of spectra ios the homotopy category of spectra. Triangulated with shift functor $\Sigma(\wait)$ with inverse $\Omega(\wait)$.
- The sphere spectrum $S^0$ is the unit for the symmetric monoidal structure, i.e. $S^0 \smash X \homotopic X, F(S^0, X) \homotopic X$.
- Pushout and pullback diagrams coincide, exact triangles $X\to Y \to Z \to \Sigma X$ are equivalently fiber and cofiber sequences.
  - $X\to Y$ is null-homotopic iff $Z \homotopic Y \vee \Sigma X$.
- Spectra as generalized homology theories: take coproducts to direct sums and exact triangles to exact sequences
  - For $E$ a spectrum, the homology theory is $E^n(X) = \pi_n(E\smash X)$.
  - For $E = HG$, $HG^\wait (A) = \tilde H^\wait (X; G) \cong HG^\wait(\Sigma^\infty X)$.
- Homotopy groups are well-defined for any spectrum, can be nonzero in negative degrees
