- Main idea: certain types of "topological field theories" are classified by certain stable homotopy classes of maps between 2 specific spectra
- Main tool: Adams spectral sequence, invented to resolve Hopf invariant one. Relates cohomology of spaces/spectra to stable homotopy
- Mod-2 cohomology of any space is a module over the Steenrod algebra
- Two important classes of isomorphisms: chain homotopy equivalences vs quasi-isomorphisms.
  - Derived category inverts quasi-isomorphisms (not an equivalence relation!)
  - Homotopy category inverts chain homotopy equivalences. In theory, easier to do.
  - For bounded below projective chain complexes, quasi-iso implies chain homotopy equivalence, so can take derived category to be projective chain complexes with chain homotopy equivalences as morphisms
- Analogy:
  - Chain homotopy equivalences for modules $\iff$ homotopy equivalences
  - Quasi-isomorphisms $\iff$ weak homotopy equivalences
