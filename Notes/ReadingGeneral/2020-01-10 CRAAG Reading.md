Conjecture:
If $\bar V$ is a variety without singular points defined over a field $k$ of algebraic numbers, we can mod out by a prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ to obtain a variety $V_{\mathfrak p}$.
Certain polynomials can be defined (?), and we define the "betti numbers of $V_{\mathfrak p}$" to be the degrees of these polynomials.
The conjecture is that these coincide with the topological betti numbers.

Consequence:
