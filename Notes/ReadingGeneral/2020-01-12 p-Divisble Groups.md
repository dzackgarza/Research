Motivation:
Studying elliptic curves, or more generally, abelian varieties $E$.
The most important object is the **$\ell\dash$adic Tate module of $E$.**
It is able to detect the ability to lift $E/k$ to the ring of integers $O_k$.

Some slogans:

- "Deformation theory for ‘blah’s is the study of smoothness for the moduli space of ‘blah’s."
- "The deformation theory of an abelian schemes coincides with the deformation theory of its p-divisible group."
