Motivation:
Studying elliptic curves, or more generally, abelian varieties $E$.
The most important object is the **$\ell\dash$adic Tate module of $E$**, $T_\ell(E)$.
It is able to detect the ability to lift $E/k$ to the ring of integers $O_k$.
Also captures the isogeny class of $E$ over a finite field, and the number of points over all finite fields.
Fails spectacularly when $E/\FF_{p^s}$ is a supersingular elliptic curve, in which case taking $\ell = p$ yields $T_p E = 0$.
Leads to considering the group schemes $E[\ell^n]$, which is etale when $\ell \neq p$, but $E[p^n]$ is never etale.
Leads to replacing $T_p E$ with the directed system $\theset{E[p^n]}_n$.

Some slogans:

- "Etale groups schemes are entirely determined by their geometric points."
- The basic idea for deformation theory is to understand when an object $X/S$ for $S$ a scheme lifts to an infinitesimal neighborhood of $S$.
  - Example: When does an elliptic curve $E/\ZZ_p$ lift to an elliptic scheme $\mathcal E / \ZZ_p$?
- "Deformation theory for ‘blah’s is the study of smoothness for the moduli space of ‘blah’s."
- "The deformation theory of an abelian schemes coincides with the deformation theory of its p-divisible group."
- $p\dash$divisible groups are systems (of finite, flat group schemes) in which each piece is the torsion of the following piece.
- Formal groups: An intermediate step between a lie group and its lie algebra.

In global Langlands, one considers moduli spaces of abelian varieties with additional structure (such as Shimura varieties).
For local Langlands, the corresponding analog are deformation spaces of abelian varieties.
