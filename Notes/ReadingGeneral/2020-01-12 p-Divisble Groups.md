Motivation:
Studying elliptic curves, or more generally, abelian varieties $E$.
The most important object is the **$\ell\dash$adic Tate module of $E$**, $T_\ell(E)$.
It is able to detect the ability to lift $E/k$ to the ring of integers $O_k$.
Also captures the isogeny class of $E$ over a finite field, and the number of points over all finite fields.
Fails spectacularly when $E/\FF_{p^s}$ is a supersingular elliptic curve, in which case taking $\ell = p$ yields $T_p E = 0$.
Leads to considering the group schemes $E[\ell^n]$, which is etale when $\ell \neq p$, but $E[p^n]$ is never etale.
Leads to replacing $T_p E$ with the directed system $\theset{E[p^n]}_n$.

Some slogans:

- "Etale groups schemes are entirely determined by their geometric points."
- The basic idea for deformation theory is to understand when an object $X/S$ for $S$ a scheme lifts to an infinitesimal neighborhood of $S$.
  - Example: When does an elliptic curve $E/\ZZ_p$ lift to an elliptic scheme $\mathcal E / \ZZ_p$?
- "Deformation theory for ‘blah’s is the study of smoothness for the moduli space of ‘blah’s."
- "The deformation theory of an abelian schemes coincides with the deformation theory of its p-divisible group."
- $p\dash$divisible groups are systems (of finite, flat group schemes) in which each piece is the torsion of the following piece.
- Formal groups: An intermediate step between a lie group and its lie algebra.
