> The Hochschild homology of an $R\dash R\dash$bimodule reflects some ring-theoretic stuff. For instance, $H_1(R,R)$ of a $k\dash$algebra $R$ is the module of differentials $\Omega_R/k$. If $Q\subseteq R$ then there is an algebraic decomposition of this homology that is analogous to the Hodge decomposition in complex manifold theory.

> Taking the above example further if $k$ is a ring and $X$ a simplicial set, the cyclic homology (Hochschild homology taking into account a cyclic action on the corresponding simplicial set) of the simplicial module $k[X]$ is the same as the $S_1\dash$equivariant homology of the geometric realization of $X$ with coefficients in $k$.

> K-theory is like homology on rings. Moreover, algebraic topology is clearly interested in vector bundles; on a nice space $X$ the category of rank $n$ $\RR\dash$vector bundles on $X$ is equivalent to the category of rank $n$ finitely generated projective modules over the continuous functions $C(X,\RR)$. The group $K_0(C(X))$ is the Grothendieck group of the isomorphism classes of finitely generated projectives.

> We look first at vector bundles over a space $X$. A vector bundle assigns a vector
space to every point of $X$. This is done in a continuous fashion. The $k\dash$dimensional
vector bundles over $X$ are equivalent to the homotopy classes of maps from $X$ to
a fixed space $BO_k, [X, BO_k]$, [Ste51]. So, as is the case with many geometric
problems, the classification of isomorphism classes of $k\dash$dimensional vector bundles
is reduced to the computation of homotopy classes of maps. Furthermore, it is clear
that studying $BO_k$ is very useful for this problem. It comes about by a standard
construction which builds a classifying space, $BG$, for any group $G$.

Amazing result: all $n\dash$dimensional manifolds, $M_n$ , immerse in $R_{2n}-\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha(n)$ is the number of ones in the binary expansion of $n$.
