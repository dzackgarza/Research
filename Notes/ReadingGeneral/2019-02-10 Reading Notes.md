> Computing various homological invariants of associative algebras (such as Tor and Ext of various modules, Hochschild (co)homology, cyclic homology etc.) has been an active research topic in ring theory for many years. More recently (about 15 years ago), ring theorists became interested in associative algebras up to homotopy, or Aâˆž-algebras, as a recipe to produce meaningful "higher structures" on classical objects like Yoneda Ext-algebras.

> This offers two different perspectives on associative algebras: homological invariants are "Abelian" (i. e. arise when one works with additive categories, e.g. chain complexes of modules over a ring), while homotopical invariants are "non-Abelian" (i. e. arise from non-additive categories, like the category of all differential graded associative algebras). However, these two perspectives are closely related, and it is often possible to recover homological information from the homotopical one, and the other way round. For experts in homotopical algebra on a larger scale (beyond the associative ring theory), this philosophy is already present in works of Stasheff and Hinich on homotopy algebras.
