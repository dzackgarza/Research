# Saturday, November 28: Introduction to $\infty\dash$categories


Dealing with size issues: take a Grothendieck Universe $\mathcal{U}$: sets whose subsets are closed under all of the usual set operations (small).


:::{.definition title="$\infty\dash$Category"}
An $\infty\dash$category $\mathcal{C}$ is a (large) simplicial set $\mathcal{C}$ such that any diagram of the form

\begin{tikzcd}
	{\Lambda_i^n} && {\mathcal{C}} \\
	\\
	{\Delta_n}
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\exists}"', from=3-1, to=1-3, dashed]
\end{tikzcd}

admits the indicated lift, where $\Lambda_i^n$ is an $i\dash$horn (a simplex missing the $i$th face) for $0 < i < n$.

:::{.remark}
All inner horns are fillable, i.e. simplicial sets are *inner* Kan complexes.
Different to Kan complexes, which include all $i$.

:::{.definition title="Functors between $\infty\dash$categories"}
A $\infty\dash$functor between two $\infty\dash$categories is a map between simplicial sets.
:::

:::{.definition title="Nerve of a category"}
Given an ordinary category $\mathcal{C}$, define the **nerve** of $\mathcal{C}$ to be the simplicial set given by
\[  
N(\mathcal{C})_n \da \ts{\text{Functors } F: [n] \to \mathcal{C}}
\]
where $[n]$ is the poset category on $\ts{1, 2, \cdots, n}$.
So an $n\dash$simplex is a diagram of objects $X_0, \cdots, X_n \in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$ and a sequence of maps.
This defines an $\infty\dash$category, and there is a correspondence
\[  
\correspond{\text{ Functors } F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}}
&\iff
\correspond{\infty\dash\text{Functors } \hat F: N(\mathcal{C}) \to N(\mathcal{D})}
.\]
Note that taking the nerve of a category preserves the usual categorical structure, since the objects are the 0-simplices and the morphisms are the 1-simplices.
