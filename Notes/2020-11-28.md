# Saturday, November 28: Introduction to $\infty\dash$categories


Dealing with size issues: take a Grothendieck Universe $\mathcal{U}$: sets whose subsets are closed under all of the usual set operations (small).


:::{.definition title="$\infty\dash$Category"}
An $\infty\dash$category $\mathcal{C}$ is a (large) simplicial set $\mathcal{C}$ such that any diagram of the form

\begin{tikzcd}
	{\Lambda_i^n} && {\mathcal{C}} \\
	\\
	{\Delta_n}
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\exists}"', from=3-1, to=1-3, dashed]
\end{tikzcd}

admits the indicated lift, where $\Lambda_i^n$ is an $i\dash$horn (a simplex missing the $i$th face) for $0 < i < n$.
:::


:::{.remark}
All inner horns are fillable, i.e. simplicial sets are *inner* Kan complexes.
Different to Kan complexes, which include all $i$.

:::{.definition title="Functors between $\infty\dash$categories"}
A functor between two $\infty\dash$categories is a map between simplicial sets.
