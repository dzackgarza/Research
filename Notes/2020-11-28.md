# Saturday, November 28: Introduction to $\infty\dash$categories


Dealing with size issues: take a Grothendieck Universe $\mathcal{U}$: sets whose subsets are closed under all of the usual set operations (small).


:::{.definition title="$\infty\dash$Category"}
An $\infty\dash$category $\mathcal{C}$ is a (large) simplicial set such that any diagram of the form
\begin{tikzcd}
\Lambda_i^n \ar[r] & \mathcal{C}\ar[d] \\
\Delta^n \arrow[ur, "\exists"] & 
\end{tikzcd}
admits the lift denoted by the dotted line, where $\Lambda_i^n$ is an $i\dash$horn (a simplex missing the $i$th face) for $0 < i < n$.
A functor between two $\infty\dash$categories is a map between simplicial sets.

:::{.remark}
All inner horns are fillable, i.e. simplicial sets are *inner* Kan complexes.
Different to Kan complexes, which include all $i$.
