# Saturday, November 28: Introduction to $\infty\dash$categories


- Grothendieck Universe: sets whose subsets are closed under all of the usual set operations.


:::{.definition title="$\infty\dash$Category"}
An $\infty\dash$category $\mathcal{C}$ is a (large) simplicial set such that any diagram of the form
\begin{tikzcd}
\Lambda_i^n \ar[r] & \mathcal{C}\ar[d] \\
 \Delta^n \ar[ur, dotted, "\exists"]&  \\
\end{tikzcd}
admits the lift denoted by the dotted line, where $\Lambda_i^n$ is an $i\dash$horn (a simplex missing the $i$th face) for $0 < i < n$.
A functor between two $\infty\dash$categories is a map between simplicial sets.

:::{.slogan}
All inner horns are fillable.

:::{.remark}
Different to Kan complexes, which include all $i$.
